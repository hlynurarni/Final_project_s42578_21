Glød,jpflying,"December 9, 2018",Food on fire,"A restaurant where food is being cooked on a grill, is a place worth visiting. Had the pleasure on a Friday together with friends so we went all in with the menu including drinks. All food was well prepared and tasteful. Restaurant is cozy, service was good and even through there were a larger group of people at some tables, sound level was nice. It’s placed in city center but away from tourist traps. Still you need to reserve a table since locals know we’re to find it. ",4

The interior is cozy and comforting, and there are plenty of amazing ciders on tap as well as a variety of delicious beers of all types. We ordered two steak pies and they were INCREDIBLE. Each came with potatoes and mushy peas and a delightful peppery gravy. The cost was very reasonable compared to other places. Also enjoyed the chat with the bartender who was super friendly.

The Storm Inn,Lesley m,"July 1, 2019",CRACKING LITTLE PUB IN THE HEART OF COPENHAGEN,"It was that time of the afternoon when our feet had given out and we just wanted to sit down and have a drink. Luckily for us, we stumbled across the Storm Inn. Its a small property on a corner in the centre of Copenhagen and but for chance, we would have crossed the road and missed it. Lovely friendly girl behind the bar, let my husband taste some of the beers and made me an excellent shandy, armed with the drinks, some Tyrells crisps and some peanuts, we were sorted for a sit down. Small but perfectly formed bar with comfortable seating, traditional British pub style with dark wood and an open fire which I am sure is very welcoming on a cold day in the middle of a Copenhagen winter. Our lovely hostess even wrote down some places for us to visit and we were amused reading the beer lists and of course, the pie list. You could imagine having a fine night in here on a cold dark evening. For us, it fitted the bill perfectly, providing a cool, friendly place to sit a while until our feet had recovered. The Storm is indeed a cracking little pub in the heart of Copenhagen.",5

Great drinks, good wine selection, bar munchies were okay, but the food was quite good. They made me a special vegan pasta dish and did a beautiful salad for my wife and added shrimp at here request. It came with a dense delicious bread. Service was a bit slow but we weren’t in a hurry. Doubt if anyone not staying there would bother visiting but if you are in the hotel it works really well.",4

The whole team was very friendly and we felt well looked after. The french bartender was extremely knowledgeable offering suggestions to our indecisive group and delivering well crafted cocktails! The interior spaces feel inpersonal but the terrace offers a great spot to relax.,4
Pier 5,22club58,"August 4, 2018",Experiences,"Staying at the Marriott, of which Pier 5 is the lobby bar, we had mixed experiences - mostly poor seeming to result from indifferent F&B management and lack of staff training. One day we ate a quick lunch and the food was good, with the service being OK. But that night we sat at the bar for maybe 15 minutes and were ignored by the bartender. Complaining to the shift F&B manager got us an acknowledgement that we should not have been ignored, but not much more. A friendly server (who had given us great service the previous night in the adjacent Midtown Grill), telling us that she had been assigned to be a bar server for the first time in many years, shared that they were understaffed and management provided no assistance. The following night we had the same experience with the same bartender ignoring us (and not recognizing us and saying that he would be with us shortly) and shift F&B management being nowhere to be seen. Maybe it was payback for a compliant the previous evening, maybe it was the standard procedure of which management approved, or maybe F&B management had not followed through with corrective action from the complaint of the previous evening. Whatever the case, the service level and attitude was so different from the outstanding employee attitudes and service levels throughout the rest of the hotel that one wonders why hotel management puts up with such a poor representation of the property.",2

Pier 5,jetlag16670,"January 4, 2009",super comfy and soundproof!,"I stayed at the Marriott with my best friend over New Year 2009: a total of 6 nights. We had a deluxe room but actually there are only 2 categories of rooms: suites and deluxe rooms. We were on the 4rth floor with a city view. The room was super large: 2 double beds, excellent linen, super clean, great tv (American and English movies on Scandinavian tv are always presented in English and subtitled which increases the choice of programs for English speaking travellers). The hotel is soundproof which is rare, even in 5 star hotels. We had to request a change of room on our first night because the heating system was not working: upon checkout, we requested a discount and they granted it without a hitch (the most expensive item on our room service bill was deleted). The hotel is not in the city center : a 20mn walk but you can always take a taxi which means you reach the city center in 3mn for 80kr. On the not so great side: the breakfast buffet is very plain and totally not worth it! which is not to be confused with the brunch buffet which is totally great. Also, beware: the high speed internet connection in the room is NOT free of charge: 155kr for 24hours. A total scam! To sum up: do not hesitate to book a stay at the Marriott if you need comfort and peace!",5

No milk on the table and we asked the servers several times for milk for the coffee and got it about 25 minutes after. The buffet table was placed a very unsuitable place as the room was small and served both 'downstairs and upstairs'.The plates were constantly empty and people just crowding up around the table waiting for food to come. The servers were told that there was no bread and again it took about 20 minutes before they filled the bread baskets. Constantly empty plates and people waiting and waiting for them to fill food supplies up. Scrambled eggs runny and not entirely as should be,small rolls hard as stone, hard cheese with no sharp knife to cut it with and a very slow staff. Will personally not recommend brunch here.",2

When I got my table, it turned out to be at the end of the bar. The worst place in the entire room. During the stay, I constantly felt I was in the way of the waiters, and both them and other guests were bumping into me.

They have amazing smoothies, quite unique combinations compared to all the other usual places. I always go there after a yoga session, as it is close to where I live. They serve tuna and salmon sandwiches as well and why I like it so much is because you can stay there for a while to study, or have a long brunch time with friends. Definitely for someone interested in good healthy food. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is the music, which in my opinion is too loud and not in the same vibe as the place and atmosphere of the concept. Sometimes the music really changes the mood, and a couple of times I had to go outside at the tables, as I could not focus on the conversation. But these things will improve with time. I think it is important to be bold with your concept in all aspects. Good luck Oha !",4

It did not taste that good for 44DKK. I was also unimpressed with the service, and it seemed many other people were as well. There were 3 staff working on a terribly busy time and it would take almost half an hour for them to clear tables after customers had left. They constantly forgot people's orders. People would wait 15 minutes before having to come and remind them. I saw this happen 3 times in a two hour visit, where people would ask where their food was and be told it had been forgotten. The only reason I gave it an average rating was because they would attempt to make amends by giving people free smoothies and drinks. I understand it happening once, but 3 times within a 2 hour window, and they weren't terribly busy, is insane. They need better management or staff.",3

It took them more than 20 minutes to bring me a beer, although they apologised for forgetting. They also forgot the drinks for a nearby table.

However, we were not even halfway of our entree and we got our main courses on the table. This was terribly deceiving because clearly that meant that we had to rush to eat the tapas and even so, the mains were totally cold when we started to eat. The food was good but cold. The fact that it was already cold ruined our dinner. I felt forced to eat fast and at the end I did not enjoy my food. There was no coordination at all between the kitchen and the waiters.

The place is ok, looks a bit tired and could be refurbished a bit, but it displays interesting objects and clothes typical of the Tibetan/nepalese areas. If you want vegetarian food, you must ask for a separate list. We had 3 veggie dishes that were delicious (I'm not sure of what we ate, but we really liked it). The price was also fair. I would suggest it to families, friends and couples who are looking for a relaxed environment. We will definitely return.",3
Himalaya Restaurant,sjvikto,"June 29, 2010",vegetarian's dream restaurant,"After cringing at the umpteenth menu of fish in sauce, my omnivore mother and I found ourselves at Himalaya, much to our delight. We have not enjoyed a meal out so much in years. Ask for the vegetarian menu, which is entirely in Danish with a happy English translation provided by our host. The vegetable filled Momo appetizer served with a dish of salad and an accompanying hot sauce was new for us and absolutely delightful with bright flavors served piping hot. For entrees, we had the vegetable in sweet and sour sauce and the tofu with cashews, peppers and onions, both of which were amazingly good with subtle citrus flavors and unique spicing. Dessert is not to be missed; keer is a rice pudding made with coconut milk, sultanas, cardomum, clove and lemon leaf. We also tried the fried coconut flour cookies served with a scoop of ice cream that hinted of anise and finished with a mango lhasi. Surprisingly affordable and with ambience of Nepal, this meal was a gem amongst the typical Nyhavn canal restaurant fare. We plan to enjoy many meals there before our departure. Definitely worth a try!",5

The food is outstanding, and the kitchen staff obviously understands both Mexican and Texan cuisine very well. In particular the Texan variants of Mexican classics are recommendable (if you are very hungry, that is). If you're in the mood for some Tex Mex, it is worth jumping the trip out to Vanløse.

Hija De Sanchez,extravelagent,"August 24, 2018",Worth a trip especially the one at the Torvehallerne Market,"Seeing Hija de Sanchez on a few shows on Netflix I was curious about it. However also being from SoCal and growing up with taco trucks I was also a bit skeptical. Since we were staying near the Norreport metro station and we were making a trip to the Torvehallerne Food Hall Market we I decided to give Hja De Sanchez a shot. It's right in the middle of the dual food halls in the back in a little stand. They were out of the chips and salsa and as previously known, the only make a 3 tacos and offer a combo of three for $15. So I was even more skeptical due to the price (Copenhagen is pricey as it is). But once the tacos came I was very impressed. That day they offered carnitas, egg, and a veggie one. The flavors were very complex and they worked! All three were super delicious albeit the $5 per taco price. I was very impressed. I knew I couldn't go into it thinking that they would be like my $2 LA taco trucks but the flavors were well combined and yummy. They make their own corn tortillas as well right in front of you. Overall I was very happy that I went and tried out the flavors.For sure I will agree that Hija is the best Mexican in Europe per their latest culinary award. The only reason why I'm not give them 5 stars is the price (they also serve pretty pricey beer and wine) but I get it since Copenhagen is a very expensive city. But it's definitely worth a try and you will be pleasantly surprised. The food hall is worth a trip although our hotel receptionist said the prices are a bit high since it's a bit touristy (but its fu ",4

Hija de Sanchez is all it’s reputed to be. Great, casual atmosphere with fun Mexican music playing in the background. Limited, but fabulous choices for options. They simply concentrate on what they do well. The barbacoa was the best we’ve had...anywhere (and my wife grew up in San Diego). We enjoyed the fried egg with tomato salsa, onion, and coriander...it was really fresh. The fresh cheese with jalapeño sauce, pickled onion and avocado was also wonderful. The tortillas are all handmade. The beer was Mexican. It was like taking a trip to Mexico in the heart of Copenhagen. Enough food to satisfy, lines move fast. We went to the location at a wonderfully diverse food market, so you could go get the dessert of your voice afterwards and follow it up with fabulous coffee. Close to Rosenborg Castle, the botanic gardens, and the Round Tower. Great place for a quick, delicious bite.",5

When they didn't approach us after a while staring at the menucards and them, we went to ask about ordering, and they said they don't do table service and kitchen had already closed.

Restaurant Paustian,morteno512,"April 18, 2019",Copenhagen has better to offer,Never coming back - had the 12 course tasting menu and the food is at best ok but not worth the 450 DKK/125 USD for the 12 courses. The waiters does not know what they are serving - one served us the wine without telling us what we had in the glass. When asked which wine was included in the wine menu she told us that the first wine was a Supermante (Spumante) - she had no clue what she was serving. She showed up at our table with five pages outlining the five wines included but couldn’t tell what was the grapes and what was the house. The food is at best indifferent- don’t really understand why Paustian would accept their name to be associated with such a restaurant. If you visit the toilet it’s not been cleaned behind the doors and everything needs some paint. Payed 3500 DKK/570 USD for five people - wouldn’t have paid one fifth if I was given the choice. Copenhagen has so much more to offer - don’t go there. Sorry for not sharing any pictures of the food - nothing worth sharing.,1

We enjoyed our meal here, though it wasn't as spectacular as others we had on the trip. I had ""fried beef tartare"", which I thought was a contradiction in terms, and in fact turned out to be what I can only describe as an extremely tasty hamburger with toppings one might usually put on raw beef (capers, onions, egg, etc.) My girlfriend was a little disappointed with the server's recommendation of salmon tartare, which, while technically proficient, had in our view too much mayonnaise for the fish's flavor to come thru.

We were definitely not disappointed. We were well received by a very friendly hostess and given a lovely window seat overlooking the water. The food menu was a little restricted that day because of an event that was taking place in the Paustian shop - but we were more than happy with what was offered. The chef made up a goat's cheese salad and we followed this by a fried steak tartare with many Danish condiments - all accompanied by a nice fresh bottle of white wine.

Restaurant Paustian,Love_Food_Travel83,"October 7, 2009",The Daily Lunch menus not up to scratch,My partner and I dined at this restaurant because we heard it recently got a michelin star. Since we had just arrvied on a flight from London we decided to eat light and choose the Daily Lunch option instead of the degustation. This was about £50 per head excluding drinks and service so I expected very tasty and flavoured balance dishes made with fresh ingredient.

First of all that thursday there weren't a lot of guests ,probably because of the summer holiday season, so it would have been the perfect opportunity to do a little extra, but instead it seem to us that there were more concerned about closing up the place so they could all go home. NOT cool. Second the food which we were told were sharing plates , but we chose a starter and a main course each. The portions were ridiculously small, and they should absolutely be ashamed of this. my chicken wings did not even have anything on the side as vegetables.

Since it had a great view of the canals and an outside table available, we thought pizza sounded good. The first server was warm and friendly. The young man who waited on us was nice enough but got our drink orders wrong. Once we ordered we waited well over and hour for individual pizzas. I ordered the Pancetta pizza. When our order arrived, the chef brought mine out personally and it was burnt to a crisp. I tried to eat it but it was inedible. The spinach tasted like it was canned spinach creating a soggy mixture on the blackened crust. My sisters wasn’t done and was so soggy the first piece she tried collapsed. We are not the type of people to complain when we are visiting a foreign country. We asked for our bill and when we went to pay we saw what was going on in the kitchen. No hair or beard nets, and workers handling the dough in very unsanitary manner.

Honestly the worst experience I have had in Copenhagen. My dish of mango and prawn salad had SO many rice noodles, no mango but pineapple and about 3 prawns.

Our waiter was nice enough, although we did wait a little while before we were offered drinks, and although it's not a major issue, no one came to check back on our main course. Ok that's the negative stuff over; now for the positive: We were unsure of what to order simply because everything on the menu looked so appetizing! We asked the waiter for a recommendation to which he offered an inexpensive selection of starters and mains; something that wasn't offered on the menu. Our starter came out in good time and included a share plate of spring rolls, prawns in a delicious shaved coconut batter, satay chicken and deep fried vegetables; accompanied with 3 assorted dipping sauces. Every starter tasted as good as it looked and the portion size was just enough. Our main course, again arriving in good time included a duck red curry, chicken and cashews and what I believe to be a beef with oyster sauce. An abundance of fresh crunchy vegetables, tender meat, and mouthwatering sauce. I could go on all day about the food but there really is no better word to describe it than 'perfection' the two of us struggled to finish the generous portions, and both of us left more than satisfied.

The character of an old pub with a few interesting stories and traditions, ask them about the hammer on the wall, for example, is quite something just like the people who come here often and work at the parliament which is just a few steps away.

But after many great experiences in Copenhagen this was a disaster.

The food was terrible: Ordered a steak medium rare and it came back over well done and tough as leather (the rest of the plate was poorly seasoned and prepared as well). Our other dish was a tuna dish. I have never seen such a grey and poor tuna ever. They could not have cared less. Also, we wanted more drinks etc, but our waiter wanted nothing to do with stopping by. It took 20+ minutes to pay and then they started saying that their credit card system just stopped working that I could go and get cash etc. I told them I would be paying with my card as they state is permissible and that I would be leaving in 2 minutes. Miraculously, the system went back online when they found out they weren't getting cash. I would avoid this place. It is not worth the money at all.",1

Cafe Phenix,hei019,"February 14, 2016",Stay clear!,"We have visited other branches of Cafe Phenix in Copenhagen with satisfaction,so when we entered this cafe Phenix in Vesterbrogade (Vesterbro Torv) we were expecting the same good food and service. Alas, this was far from what we thought it would be. It started off well,we were handed the menus upon entering the locale and the waitress promptly served the ordered wine and beer. From then on,it was all downhill,I'm afraid. We ordered two pasta dishes: one w meat and ' spring onions,parsley and Madagaska pepper' according to the description, and one classic pasta carbonara with 'spring onions,ham,egg and topped with parmiggiano flakes ', still quoting from the menu. All pasta to be served with 'home-made bread'.The food took quite some time in arriving,but the wine and beer were both nice,so we did not mind too much. Then it came. Two generous plates that at first looked impressive. Then the downfall: no trace of either spring onions or parsley. If pepper was at all present,it was certainly not the flavourful characteristic pepper described in the menu. In fact,both dishes were so bland and lacking in taste, one would be tempted to believe they had not seen any pepper or other spices at all. But the worst part was the ham in the carbonara. Now,I HAD noticed it said ham and not bacon or smoked ham as I am used to w a carbonara but these were thick,long (1/4 inch thick and at least 2 inches long/ 0,5x5 cms at least)bland slabs of ham, suspiciously similar to the canned variety,actually much bigger than the penne pasta that were the pasta type in both dishes. Totally not apetizing. Needless to say, I only managed a few bites.The 'homebaked' bread was a pita bread cut in two,warm but not what we would expect. To make matters even worse, no one came to inquire how we liked the food or to ask if we needed refill on our beverages. There were just a few guests so the staff were not rushed or overworked,they just were nowhere to be seen. In the end,I had to go and look for them to get to pay. I told them that we were not at all pleased and why, and that it is poor customer treatment not to check up on the table at least once. The reply was 'Sorry, Madam ' and that was that. Copenhagen is full of lovely,charming restaurants w excellent food and service. Sadly, this is not one of them.",1

The food arrived sharpish - the chips seemed freshly cooked and were tasty but the burger was just so bland.

Liberty Burgers & Grill,nick e,"May 4, 2016",An excellent place to eat,"I visit this place for lunch quite often, because it is without a doubt the best burger restaurant in the Fisketorvet shopping centre. The restaurant has fairly recently had a make-over (it used to be called 'The President') and has *really* picked up it's game. What you see on the menu (reasonably standard, very much like the Halifax chain, if you know them) isn't the end of the story. You can ask for any combination of fillings for your burger and they will keep you happy. My partner invariably wants no salad, no mayo etc., just a beef patty and fried mushrooms in her burger bun. And no fries. No problem. The wait-staff are very friendly, professional and eager for you to have a good eating experience. The cook(s) know their stuff too. The produce is always fresh (I hate limp lettuce so much), and you can tell that the food is cooked by someone who knows and is interested in what he/she is doing, which is quite a surprise in a place like this. Apart from Burgers, there is the usual variety familiar to Danes on the menu, including really (and I mean really) good fish and chips. Also on offer are Milkshakes (both standard and alcoholic versions) and a selection of wines and some surprisingly nice beers. I rate this place very highly - it certainly stands head and shoulders above the local competition, and is easily way better than many of the cafes in downtown Copenhagen for service, value for money and quality of food (and I've tried most of them). Top marks from an experienced local diner.",5

Great quality of food (I am myself an Indian, so I must say that at some point, I felt like I was eating in India and not in Denmark- the food was so good that is tasted 100% of what we have back in South India), Plus, it was extremely affordable compared to other restaurants in Copenhagen- only 79kr for the deal of 1 Premium Dosa + Soft Drink (I think there was some time limitations, probably in the lunch time only this deal was valid). I don't get this quality where I stay in the UK, so I would say that please keep up the good work- whenever I'm returning to Copenhagen, my first choice for food will definitely be The South Indian Fields!",5

Charming and sincere REAL Italian owners and working managers, delivering polite and entertaining service and top-notch food. Freshest plumpest tomatoes on lightly toasted ciabatta like bread with just the right amount of garlic and oil. The Saltimbocca was exquisite, and a beef serloin so tender i ould have used a fork only! A speial note to the Gorgonzola sauce, probably the best in town. All washed down with a pleasant house white, chilled perfectly for the warm evening. And after this pleasant man has served such a feast for eye and belly, I did not even have to cry or take out a new mortgage to pay. Again, the perfect end to a perfect day.

Unfortunately, we waited 25 minutes before getting the menu, which we had to ask for. We then waited ages and ages for the wine and sparkling Water. When the first course eventually came, it was delicious, however after the long wait, our mood was not as light as it had been. The waiters are definately not professional , two old chaps, with not much of a smile or personality. The restuarant was fully booked with lots and lots of Italians (a good sign when it is an Italian restaurant). The food was good and tasty, but the wait was far toooooooo long.

The night we were there they had a lemon chicken dish on pasta, and portobello mushroom and goat cheese dish, also on the same pasta.

So I ordered the most traditional of them all: kabab soltani. and it was great: good quality meat, nicely done rice and tasting very very good :-) I also tried my friends mahiche. that was not as it would taste in Iran (actually i cant remember that taste anymore. but it wasnt that). It was somehow better or at least a little upgrade, maybe to please Danish tastes. And it worked. So try it out. Only remark: the wine could be much much better.",4

Restaurant Zafran,SupremeSerendipity,"June 24, 2011",First time – wouldn’t be my last time,"This was my first Persian/Iranian food adventure and I can happily say that it was a great first experience at Zafran. The restaurant stands cozy on an equally cozy street in Copenhagen. The street is always full of life, buzzing with people and lined up with restaurants offering different cuisines. Zafran is moderately decorated with antique knick knacks that voice a Persian ambience. The fact that there are Iranian people eating there as regulars, should also confirm the fact that the food is authentic, and authentic it is. We were there for dinner and started with the Grilled mashed eggplant, Dolma (grape leaves filled with rice and veggies) and pickled vegetables, which was fantastic! Although, the eggplant is to die for – really! For main course we got a mix of grilled Lamb and minced beef kebabs on skewers and saffron chicken kebab on skewer. Man o man! The chicken kebabs were simply amazing. The kebabs come along with veggies, rice and a sauce to match with on the side - all good. The appetizers come along with a bread that is very delicious and soft, and goes very well with the eggplant dish. The marination for all that they make is well thought of and well spiced up with slight nuances of Indian and Pakistani foo ",5

It's a small, but cozy place, loved the interior. There was only one girl working there, that probably was totally new that day, and she was alone at work. She didn't know anything about the food or the wine, and even told us that they didn't have more bubbles (don't remember if we ordered Cava, Prosecco or Cremant??), so we ordered white wine instead. Later, when I went to the toilet, there was a whole fridge downstairs filled with wine and bubbles... Strange that she didn't notice, walking by a hundred times!

If you so is alone inside the Kantina with only staff around you, you enjoy it - especially the music - as well-cured as ever the food, drinks and art. So exquisite aesthetic in its simplicity! Evening hours, the bar turns into a boiling water hole for all sorts of people, students and gallerists, musicians and models, celebrities and the ordinary - like you and me - who slip in for a nice moment.

This place is to recommend and I ll go back.",5
Le Basilic,Steinar V,"May 21, 2014",As French as it gets in Copenhagen,"Le Basilic is tucked away on a side street in Copenhagen's Vesterbro quarter, and the contrast from the street it's on to the mixed style ambience of the restaurant is striking. Way back, this must have been an old neighbourhood pub or inn. Today, it radidates warmth and cozyness - and love for food and wine. The entire staff is tri-lingual; French, English and Danish - friendly and old-school professional. The food is French to the detail, full of taste and somewhat sturdy, and yet with an elegant twist. The prices are fair and the wine list is impressively extensive, however almost entirely French. One of my favourite restaurants in Paris is Le Basilic on Rue Lepic up at Montmartre. Its Danish name-twin is almost as good - and almost as French.",4

The waiter was nice and efficient, but would not serve us tap water, and the bread arrived together with the food. Luckily there are better alternatives in Vesterbro.",3

There was an excellent wine list and the blackboard wines by the glass excellent. The waiter was very nice and service was good. The atmosphere was cosy and the ambience was warm.",5
Le Basilic,Erik L,"December 13, 2012",Value for money and extremely high quality,"The location of the restaurant is humble: in a street where many sort of strange shops and multicultural groups are giving the area an image of "" NO GO "", you suddenly get to a place , where you find peace! The restaurant is small, maybe 40 seats, located in a building, which is probably more than 150 years old. The rooms are renovated with respect for the quality of the building,It is a place where you can take your dear one or your business associates. The service is top quality,polite and professional. And the food is simply delicious. French inspired. And not fat at all, the night we went there, all seats we taken. Thats redlects on both the quick turnover of the food ( ensure freshness )and the price for your meals, which is in the cheap end. For two persons who eat and drink 2 or 3 dishes each, the bill will be around EUR 150, incl wine or beer plus water.My warmest recommendation to both Danes and tourist coming to Denmark. And it IS in 10 min walking distance from the Town Hall.",5

Small and intimate in atmosphere, the touch is very personal, and the as well as being very professional, the waiting staff and owners seemed to make sure that they had time for each diner in the room. I sensed that the owners are working really hard to get Le Basilic onto the ""A List"" of CPH eateries and if they keep it up, they will certainly succeed. I can thoroughly recommend it",5

Osterbros Originale Burgerrestaurant,Dimitris_SC30,"September 11, 2016",Unpleasant experience,"This is the second time we came here, so what I will report is not a single time fluke. The main reason why we tried again is because we really love the burgers served at its sister restaurant in vestebro. We came on Saturday evening so it was very busy. No problem there it can get overwhelming. There was a more than obvious problem in the communication between the kitchen and the waiters, seeing them in more than 10 occasions going around with plates on their hands with no clues for whom they were destined and asking clients if they had ordered them. And when one waiter had done his/her round with the burgers, the next one would do it again, just wandering around with the plates! After we sat down, it took 20min to give our order, which again it was not just our problem, as other customers, like us, went and handed in their orders themselves. 25-30min later we received our burgers, chips and a wrong sauce/dip. No harm done, I went and asked for the correct one. If the food had been good or even average all of the previous problems would have been forgotten, alas it was not. My beef burger was average, a bit on the dry side with only hints of the described sauce. My girflriend's chicken burger, almost identical to the last time we were here, was far worse. It was undercooked, the quality of the meat was definitely subpar (some pieces were unchewable) and because of the overall haste to prepare it and serve it, it was not a single entity anymore, but just random pieces put together. If this was one time thing, I wouldn't pay so much attention to it, but since the for the second time the food was either average or unedible, we won't be coming back any time soon.",2

It took pretty long for our food to come, and I was really annoyed by the male service staff who seemed like he kept arguing with his female colleague throughout the time we were there.

What could be simpler? :) The burgers are standard good with nice potatoes (fries or big wedges), the pasta also standard good - they do a *very* nice Brie and Bacon sandwich, which is of course in the open-sandwich style, with plenty of nice salad...you can't fault the food or the service - this is not far from where I live and I'm very happy to recommend it highly.",4

Then we went 4 people together and shared the following sides; the wings, ribs, vinegar/salt fries, curly fries, onion rings and a mini sallad. The dips; chilli mayo, estragon mayo and the guacamole. Then I had the New York burger and it really was good. It all was good. I wasn't that impressed with the wings and the ribs but I loved the vinegar/salt fries and the dip sauces. I was so stuffed when I left the place and I would guess we used about 200 each. Not that bad!

As many of you will know, it gets said about a lot of burger places and sadly not many of them live up to the hype. Yet, this time I'm happy to say that Cocks & Cows definitely did. I had ""Ze Brazil"" with chili-grilled beef patty, mozzarella & chilli mayo. It struck the perfect balance of having a tinge of spice but not overwhelming the taste. It's also a bit of a cliche but the patty was extremely succulent and just melted in my mouth. I also loved the fact that you can choose different buns for you burgers, including wholegrain which I haven't seen done elsewhere.

I was presented with a small overcooked piece of cod which was smaller than the palm of my hand. When I complained the young guy who served me did not offer an apology or seem at all sorry, he simply offered a replacement. Not wanting to wait, I asked for a portion of fries instead. They came out dry, like they had been sitting around a while. Most of my collegues ordered steak and their food looked better. It strikes me as the sort of place that doesn't cater that well for people who don't eat meat. I was really underwhelmed by the experience and wouldn't go back.",1

We ordered the tapas plate and the marinated meat and we both commented on the high quality. The house wine is good and they have non-alcoholic beer - for us an added quality.

Sushi Saiko,chiej,"October 11, 2015",Not Bad Sushi,"We were walking around Copenhagen, tired and hungry when we came upon this restaurant. Went went on tripadvisor for reviews but there wasn't any recent ones. Anyway, when we walked in we were not sure if it was open or not although there was a sign by the door saying open, the place looked empty. There was a group of 4-5 girls but they were sat at the back and were the only customers. Once we figured out who the waiters are, we were guided into a table and handed a menu. I was personally interested with the rice bowls advertised outside the restaurant but it was not on the menu given to us. I could have asked for it I supposed but just decided to change my order. At this point there was only 1 waiter who seemed to be manning the bar as well as the kitchen.

Jensens Boefhus Copenhagen (Axeltorv),Mark L,"May 16, 2017",Good stop for lunch,Jensen Bofhus is a chain restaurant. This particular location is on a square (The Triangle) and is very convenient for public transportation in this area of Copenhagen. The atmosphere is casual but very nice. The food is primarily beef with steak as a specialty. The portions are nicely sized for a reasonable lunch. The steaks have a multitude of side dishes that can be added inexpensively. Neither the sizes nor the prices are excessive. There are also various hamburgers. There is one fish dish. Our group of three all ordered one of the steaks and found them very go ,4

Jensens Boefhus Copenhagen (Axeltorv),TimeSignature,"September 20, 2014","Tourists in Copenhagen, stay away from this place: slow service and low quality","Jensen's Bøfhus is a Danish chain of steakhouse restaurants. I have visited this and many other Jensen's restaurants several times and witnessed a radical decline in quality and service. In the Jensen's Bøfhus on Axeltorv, the major problem is the slow service. The staff can be extremely slow to take, and serve, your order. We actually did leave the restaurant once, because it took them more than half an hour to take our order, and ended up in another restaurant on Axel Torv. The quality of their salad bar has dipped with several of the best salad components having been dropped and replaced with sub-par (and presumably cheaper) ones. The food is not real steakhouse quality, but really just fastfood in disguise, and there are no trained chefs in the kitchen, as the dishes are merely pre-made from a factory and merely reheated in the restaurant. The food is not necessarily bad, and their pork steak is typically okay. The chain recently introduced a new menu with a couple of new items, including beef cornotto and teriyaki salmon on a bed of noodles. I have tried both and it really seems that the kitchen staff (maybe because they're not trained cooks) do not appear to be particularly good at making these dishes, although the second time I tried the salmon dish, it was okay. Some of the staff members come across as sympathetic people, but there have been too many times where they've been chatting amongst themselves rather than serving customers. The slow service is one of the major reasons for my dislike of this particular Jensen's Bøfhus... and we have really given them many, many chances. Because of the incredibly slow service and the unauthentic food, I strongly recommend tourists in Copenhagen to not visit this Jensen's Bøfhus. It should also be mentioned that the Jensen's company recently sued a small fish restaurant named Jensens Fiskerestaurant because of the use of Jensen in its name (it should be mentioned that Jensen is one of the most common surnames in Danish, and Jensen is the name of the owner of the fish restaurant), forcing the small fish restaurant to give up its name and to pay large amounts of money to Jensen's Bøfhus. I mention this, because I think that visitors to Denmark who are against capitalist aggression towards minor local businesses should at least know this about Jensen's Bøfhus in case they do not feel comfortable supporting major chain operation. My recommendation to tourists interested in authentic Danish steakhouses or Danish cuisine in general is that they avoid Jensen's Bøfhus and seek out authentic, local restaurants or cafés in Copenhagen instead... or at least less dubious restaurant chains. There are several much better alternatives on Axeltorv.",1

The venue itself was lovely, seated by the waterside with view of pirate ship and lights but our main course was pretty revolting and neither my partner nor I could eat much of the meal. The ""hash"" I ordered was full of unpalatable chewy, tough, fatty, gristly beef which I could not stomach and a huge pile of cubes of potatoes (so uniform they might have been tinned) drowned in Worcester sauce. My partners meal was of the same calibre: it was claimed to be ""beautifully slow-roasted pork"" but was a number of pork rashers cooked to a crisp and so hard he could not eat it without risk to his teeth and most was left on the plate. This was served with beetroot, parsley sauce, new potatoes and some dry black bread and butter which constituted a very strange meal. When the waiter took our plates and saw I had barely touched my meal he showed no interest in the fact I had just paid 140 DK for something I had not eaten. When I commented that this was not food as my mother used to make he said ""You are in Denmark and this is food MY mother used to make. With a beer and a starter (no problems there) the meal came to 460 DK which was a real waste of money so be careful what you choose off this menu.

The sandwich menu looked good, with some imaginative offerings (chocolate, banana, cocoa, and blueberries - on a sandwich? Yes, that is imaginative!).

Croque Madame arrived with the think I’m allergic to and had specified and had checked ALL over, sent back and explained they needed to make a new one or I’d end up in hospital. Second attempt arrived on wheat bread. Sent back. Third attempt was a croque monsieur (not what I’d ordered) on rye so ate it and let them know it was wrong.

Plus the Danish portions are very small comparing to what you pay for the dish. Skip the dessert pizza, it was nothing special. All in all a pleasant restaurant, with friendly staff.

In this case it doesn't from the vast majority of tables as there is only one (repeat one) main window in the restaurant. If you're lucky in terms of seating and have an agile neck, you may be able to get a view of Copenhagen - but otherwise you're much better off by going to the public viewing section of the tower which, by the way, is free. Further, if you are a couple, you may end up - as my wife and I did - being seated literally next to another couple, with only a few inches separating the table.

Mirabelle,Jes C,"February 14, 2019",An all together average experience,"Went for dinner with a friend and found the food quite good, varied and tasty. However, standing in the way for an over average dining experience was the service and the fact that a place like this has the guts to charge 20 DKK for a tiny cup of olive oil, since the bread served does not come with butter. We managed to order twice before we saw the DKK 40 on the bill. Waiters do not speak Danish, which is not normally an issue, but they seemed as if they could not care less. Forgot to show the label of the bottle after pouring the wine, seemed bored while waiting to take our order and in general just a bit indifferent.",3
Mirabelle,dancerjohn,"December 8, 2018",Best meatballs ever,We came here for lunch and had a wonderful salad (much needed as getting a good salad in winter was HARD) and meatballs. The kale salad and just perfect. Beautiful greens and perfectly dressed. Only good salad / greens we had during the trip. The highlight (of what we had) was the meatballs. They were the best we have ever had (wife is part Italian) and we had to discuss who was getting the last bit (result being private). The pastries looked great and I wished I had any room left for one.,4
Mirabelle,304leeb,"October 12, 2018","Great breakfast, better pastries!","We visited Mirabelle twice for breakfast during our week long stay in Copenhagen - the breakfast plate (amazing breads, cheese, fruit compote, pickles, eggs, bacon and wonderful sausage, apple juice) is great...on both occasions we shared a breakfast plate and had a pastry each. The pastries are next level excellent and certainly up there as the best we have ever had. The almond croissant is THE best and the daily specials (pumpkin pie pastry on the first visit and quince and ricotta pastry on the second) were really good! We didn’t get to try the sandwiches but they looked amazing!",5

Mirabelle,lulu_aka_pinky,"September 5, 2018",Sooooo expensive and not that great,"I ordered breakfast there on my way to the movies next door. The plate was 1 piece of ryebread, one piece of sourdough bread, 2 slices of cheese, 1 marmalade, an egg and some ham. That was 75Dkk. Plus tea 35dkk which is a breakfast for more than 100dkk. For that price I expect something great. The sourdough bread was cut very thick, which is a rooky mistake. I'd much rather you give me 2 thin slices so I can actually dip it in the egg like I'm supposed to. Plus the crust was black and burned. They pride themselves on being old school and high quality bakers but if you ask me this is an overpriced hipster and overrated place. ",2

Anyway moving on...I think i had booked a table in advance ( I usually don't risk rejection when travelling with my son where food is concerned). It was relatively quiet when we arrived with a few tables of locals and a constant coming and going to the bakery counter. A simple and beautiful little cafe/ bakery as you'd expect.

Tasteless and can only be described as a waste of money. A glass of wine each at 49 kroner per glass the same price as you can buy a bottle of wine in the Supermarket added insult to injury.

Now when it comes to the food, it looks very nice and I would say most of it tasted ok,but some of the dishes were so overpowered by an element that I could barely eat them. We had a salmon starter that comes with 4 or 5 different quenelles and one of them is fermented black garlic puree that is extremely salty for the quantity of it on the dish. The lobster hotdog is ok if you like lemongrass because that's what you mostly taste. One of the oysters that I had as a starter had so much passion fruit that I couldn't taste the oyster at all. And last but not least most of the courses come with a significant amount of undressed micro cresses that can ruin the entire dish if you eat them ofcourse.

Best food we ate on our 4 day trip to København. The location, the interior and atmosphere as well, superb, 5 stars! The service though... English speaking guy inside and a tall tattooed guy with pearcings outside were very rude. Like not just normal rude with not smiling and such, but actually rude commenting and so on. The top one probably being when 2 lovely young ladies came in and asked (in Danish) if there were free tables inside and the guy rolls his eyes and says ""I don't understand what your saying"".

Copenhagen is nearly unrivalled, in my view, when it comes to the creativeness of the cuisine and professionalism in how it is presented. But if there's been a blind spot in what Copenhagen has had to offer, something you can get in many great food cities but not here, it's been late night options. Too many of Copenhagen restaurants are closing their kitchens by 10 PM. Not here. We didn't come late, but we stayed for a while, and there was a steady flow all night of new customers. I guess the flow must tail off as it gets later, but I saw no sign of it before we left. We had the 600 DKK menu, and a series of small plates, starters, pasta, mains, and dessert, all bearing obvious relation to the season (fall, so delicata squash, etc). They have an excellent small collection of vermouth's for aperitifs, and a nice wine list. Service was excellent. We had a pregnant lady among us, and they were careful about guiding her to choices that put any worries she might have had (e.g., raw cheeses) to rest. Excellent as well, was was the pacing. We never felt rushed, but we also never felt that the time was overly long between courses. The food was well balanced from course to course. All offerings were strong, nothing towering above the rest, though the octopus was exceptional.

But the portion size is way too small. For 120 kr per wrap (incl a juice) I would expect to be full. My husband finished his wrap in less than two minutes and then went straight to the fridge to make an extensive supplementary meal. We consider ourselves to have normal appetites. A portion at Homemate, which is btw 90/110 kr usually leaves us plenty full, sometimes with leftover food. So while the food at Palaeo is good, the portion size vs price is simply not ok.",3

I saw the guy make the egg wraps and he basically looked like he couldn't care less. The only thing in it was raw cabbage and nothing else. I am sure their margins are very high if this is how they sell it. Also we ordered several other things such as some of their 'shots' and juices and coffee's, side dishes (the sweet potatoes were really good) and desserts. I at the same time when ordering asked the girl behind the corner if I could just get some hot water as I had to take some cold medicin I had to dilute in this water. She was already very confused as it was and it seemed she wasn't trained very well overall. Anyway she charged me for a tea and I told her it was only hot water and didn't want the tea leaf. She became very rude and said that management's rules were to charge full price for hot water even though you didn't take a tea leaf. I told her to forget it and I didn't want it. She then went and threw out the tea water. Just thought this little detail was poor service as I ended up spending a lot of money there for me and my friends.

So I was already going a little less often because of the price hike, but yesterday I saw something that made me lose my appetite for Palaeo completely. I gave my order to the guy behind the counter, who relayed it to a man putting together the orders next to the food area. I sat down and watched while he used his bare hands to fling the different lettuce, cabbage and carrot components into my takeaway box and then MIX them with the same bare hands.

When we arrived about 12 it was absolutely packed, so a waiter advised us to walk around and come back in about an hour as the kitchen was so busy, which we did and he remembered us. We had some fresh smoothies and tea/coffee followed by choosing 5 small plates each from the menu selection, which varied from eggs to samosas and chutney. Sat outside with a great view of the lake and as it was a bit cool in mid-Sept we were under a heater by the wall with blankets, which was all very hygglig. It would have been just as cosy indoors with all the wood panels and tables. Turned out to be one of the highlights and happy memories of a weekend in Copenhagen. Not cheap at about 400DK for 2 after a few more coffees, but then nothing is cheap in CPH. A little non-touristy gem.",5

The staff were very rude, especially our server, Lars (bald guy), we ordered apple juice for our kids, he brought some sort of drink and without saying anything, left it at the table, when our kids started drinking it, they hated it, so we discovered that it was apple fizzy drink with GINGER… really for kids???? we complaint to this guy Lars, and we told him that we shouldn’t be charged, as he brought something we didn’t ask for, and the kids didn’t drink it… he became ballistic, aggressive and hostile with no manners, If he cant work as a waiter, maybe he should be working nowhere. Anyhow, he said it was our responsibility to do our homework (HOMEWORK??? I told him that we were in a Bar not in a plastic surgery clinic) and to know what we are asking for, that we were responsible to read the menu and know what we are asking for as responsible adults. Of course, after arguing with him that it wasnt apple juice, he said that we could walk away and not pay for anything but we wont be welcome anymore he was just a waiter btw... of course we paid as we didnt want the bar discount the wrongly served juices from his wage, and we wont come back ever, as the service in general was slow, and nobody really in charge to solve the situation...so avoid this place as much as you can, don't go there and if by mistake you do, ensure you ask all the ingredients in your food, drink or whatever, ready many times the menu, do your homework and good luck if you are allergic.

Not a lot of choices for bar food, or lunch/dinner. We opted for a burger and chicken sandwich. The portions are huge – really too much for a single person unless you are really hungry. The burger came with bacon and Danish cheese, and was cooked to a medium rare perfection. The chicken sandwich was very large.

The burger was delicious - juicy and flavorful, and the fries were super tasty. We indulged in dessert which was an unusual concoction, the only wheat free option, but it was light and delectable. Do note that as with so many places in Copenhagen, you will be charged for tap water. With so many less expensive places to eat nearby, this may not be the best one for you.

The frites were not potato as westerners know this but more a kind of sweet potato, very tasty and different. The salad was a mixed salad. The meat comes served on a wooden board, this is attractive for the meat display.

Stefanos Pizza,Lars R,"June 18, 2020","Hostile service, anger management needed","To be upfront, we did not taste the food, as we were the victims of the temper tantrums of the staff. We sat down to enjoy pizza from Stefanos Pizza and Mikkeller beer from down the street. They share the same tables, so it's encouraged to mix the two. When we entered the restaurant to order our pizzas, we were greeted by a polite and service-minded waiter who happily accommodated us. His eagerness to be of service was quickly over-shadowed by his senior member of staff, who, confidently and possible drunk or under substance abuse, was incredibly aggressive towards our party. He was not in a condition to operate the cash register, and decided to direct his anger at us. He yelled at us repeatedly for presenting him our card and effectively chased us out of the restaurant. We had cash, but he did not care. There is nothing we could have done to trigger his anger - we only ordered two pizzas from the menu and the angry gentlemen did not even help us with our order. His sole purpose was to (fail to) operate the cash registry. Needless to say, we did not feel safe in the restaurant and instantly took off. This is not a place for families, or people who like good service, or people who would like to successfully order an item or two from the menu. If the manager reads this, the red-faced old man should be fired. If he is the manager, I have no doubt that the restaurant will close down due to his incompetence. I am not worried about that. But I am worried about Mikkeller, which is a reputable brand and which have disastrously failed to pick a worthy partner in crime. It did not feel good to uproot our party and leave the premises, but I am very glad our mood was not poisoned by his aggressive demeanour and hostile attitude.",1

The cafe is spacious and there is a large space with children books and toys of all sorts. Management are indulgent and happy with the level of noise. The waitress spoke perfect English and was very friendly, although the service was quite slow. We had two single lattes (34DKK each) and a cupcake (25DKK), which seemed quite expensive. But the atmosphere was so relaxed and child friendly that we may go again. Lots of nice organic food available too including the traditional sandwiches for 60DKK.",4
Café Sweet Surrender,queensy83,"November 4, 2015",Kid friendly café run by volunteers in Copenhagen,"This place is a hidden gem for families with small kids! They have a special area dedicated to them, with a table, sofas and chairs of their size, paper and colors to paint, toys to play with and books to read. Our daughter is totally entertained while we can enjoy a coffee or a nice brunch. They also have child menu, of course :)",5
