We started with a summer soup based on an onion broth with corn and tomatoes which in our opinion lacked taste. It was followed by a crispy empanada with cod topped with fresh cheese and cabbage. Then a beautiful tasty ceviche with octopus, shrimps and mussels. We had to finish the juice with our spoons. A tostado with seaweed was excellent and surprising. Finished with a tortilla with beef and potatoe dices. We might not have got it all right along the way but everything was well explained. Good cocktails. The room is very airy and cosy, quiet music in the background. A strong recommendation and we are looking forward to coming back. ",4
Restaurant Sanchez Copenhagen,LilWagner,"August 23, 2020",Rude server,"Went for brunch this weekend, used to love their brunch but they changed the menu so that you can only order ‚Äúbrunch menu‚Äù and not individual dishes, plus they removed my favourite dish. Anyway it would have all been fine but we had the rudest server (tall light brown hair ?Danish guy with a moustache) who was completely unfriendly, intentionally difficult and inflexible. Plus he kept ignoring my attempts to get his attention. (The woman and other younger guy working were both nice, but unfortunately we got Mr Grumpy).

Restaurant Sanchez Copenhagen,iceboxlogic,"September 23, 2019",Nix Mex Dansk @Sanchez,"I love great restaurants‚ÄîI've worked in a few, as has my daughter, with whom I went for our last dinner in Copenhagen on this trip. We're Canadians and both work in tech and were psyched for a night out after a day at the superb Louisiana museum. We'd had a smashing meal at Mother (mother.dk) the night before‚Äîa chaotic, snug pizza place full of life and passion. Sanchez *looks* like it's the real deal...but it's not. The portions are nanoscopic and here's the thing. We sat at the end of the bar and had a clear line of sight through into the prep area. Back in my misspent youth, I was a sous-chef and my daughter, now at Facebook in SFO, has worked front-of-house at Nota Bene, the Italian hit restaurant in Toronto. Let me put it this way: your waiter is making your dinner at Sanchez. And the tortillas come from a Tupperware container: they're not made to order. Sanchez is basically a con job, folks. The finish work is good and the ingredients excellent, no question: but this place ain't the real deal. Ersatz: smoke and mirrors. My daughter's benchmark is (https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d614164-Reviews-Colibri_Mexican_Bistro-San_Francisco_California.html). And here's the worst part:for us, sitting at the bar, the service was careless, inattentive and...slow. We waited 40 minutes for our mains. Four-zero. No apologies, no 'we're really busy'...zip. The tab for a beer, two cocktails, a shared app and a shared dessert, and two tasting plates was 885DKK. That's US$130. We are unfailingly good tippers (20% or more for really wonderful experience) but we didn't leave a kroner. We felt *that* ripped off. Go to mother (https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g189541-d1898372-Reviews-Mother-Copenhagen_Zealand.html) or Manfred's, superb organic locavore cooking and dead on service...and your waiter is likely a chef ;) https://www.tripadvisor.ie/Restaurant_Review-g189541-d2536043-Reviews-Manfreds-Copenhagen_Zealand.html)",1

Restaurant Sanchez Copenhagen,ccdchen,"July 27, 2019",Way too expensive,"I was here with a friend and we were recommended to share three entrees and the two tacos on the menu. We had a tuna tortilla which was excellent but very small, and some fried pork skin and guacamole at around 100kr Per entree. The price for the tuna tortilla could almost be ok since tuna is expensive, However it was such a small dish. And 95kr for crisp skin and another 95kr for a guacamole which was again small in portion and not very interesting tastewise is just too much. The tacos were very good and we finished with their churro/parfait dessert which was lovely - at another 95kr each! Then add that we just had water and one og us a cold hibiscus tea (for 50kr a glass!) and a filter coffee.. 850kr for a meal for two!!! That's expensive - even for Copenhagen where there are lots of places with a good quality 5 plate menu for 350kr.

Although the open kitchen shows many chefs busy at work the food produced is very basic and lacking in the flavours expected. Of course basic can be good .. honest fresh produce, simply assembled is delicious but sadly Sanchez did not do justice to Mexican cuisine. We have tasted much better street food and can honestly say you could make better guacamole dip and chips (extortionately priced) and Pico de gallo at home.

I found Sanchez to have neither. There was a lot of hype attached to this restaurant and I found none of the dishes on our tasting menu to be good. The service was just a bit nicer than rude.

We ordered two tacos of the day each as well as some ‚Äústarters‚Äù. The starts were so small I thought it was a joke. Literally three chips with a small bowl of bland salsa for DKK 90. The ‚Äúmain‚Äù if you can call it that was barely a snack. The whole time the staff do whatever they can to up sell you.

Restaurant Sanchez Copenhagen,WernMachine,"January 7, 2018",Great atmosphere thanks to its popularity but odd taste combinations lacking any overall flavour coherence.,"Opted for the favourite servings and drinks pairing, the aqua frescas were good but the beer was some local IPA - and truly awful - and the mezcal that followed drowned any future flavour. The oysters tasted like nothing, in my opinion. The soup was tomato-based with grasshoppers and tasted, like nothing I have had before, more like an experiment gone wrong, the grasshoppers were the highligt. 3 small potatoes were served as if they were as precious gems with some parmesan cheese on top and on a ‚Äòbed of cream cheese‚Äô, wow! I was beginning to feel skeptical by this point, the emperors new potatoes? The taco of day was fish, it was overcooked, burned in a deep-fry really, and it should not have left the kitchen. The panuchos were topped with a salad mixture, nothing to to complain nor write home about, and the carnitas were identical to the taco but filled with slow cooked pork. A light red was served with the carnitas rather than the recommended chardonnay, since our preference was red. Light red was selected by the waiter so as not to 'overwhelm the flavour' but the smoky mezcal dominated the palate by this point. At 100 Euro per person, I left with a bad mezcal taste in the mouth, that terrible sense of feeling cheated, even if you haven‚Äôt been, because you decided to go eat there based on someone else‚Äôs recommendation and not your own research. Streetfood is for the street, where it is more somethings better and always cheaper than what's served here, so do yourself a favour, save a bundle of money, skip the faux-chic pretence of Shanchez and have decent beer and a taco at La Neta in N√∏rrebro.",2

The menu card presented the food in known thai denominations but did`nt contain any kind of description of the content. When it was served it was not what it should be in thai cuisine and the portions were very small. In total the food was very much overpriced.

The Pad Thai was fresh with tasty shrimp and with dried chillies, soya and fish sauce on the side you could spice it up to taste. The Red duck curry was also good with nice sticky rice.

It is one of the best Thai restaurants when it comes to good Thai food to reasonable prices. From the outside not very much will tell you this. The owner is definitely too modest in my opinion. So don¬¥t hesitate. Walk right in even if you have to walk through a lower part of the restaurant and up the stairs. There you will be part of an intimate and warm atmosphere, where the food can be enjoyed from a real Thai kitchen. Mild or strong is up to you. Just tell the nice waitress what you want. This is important to know, because today you too often meet Thai food the European way ‚Äì no spices at all. I can¬¥t find any dish of importance missing on the menu.

The fellow behind the counter told me that they made all their own ice cream, so I ordered a small cup or cherry sorbet. It was, by far, the best sorbet I've ever eaten in my life. It was very soft, as though there was some juice floating around the base of the cherry ice. But the entire thing was bursting with flavor...amazing! On a scale of 1-to-10, I've give it around a 14.

The food nonetheless was a huge disappointment. They could have done so much more with such seasonable and good quality ingredients. The dishes were inconsistent, didn't make me feel full or comforted or surprised me, nothing. I didn't like some of them, the rest were average and two of them way too salty.

Entry to the roof is up a external spiral staircase by the side of some bins which thankfully we didn't have to use on departure as we were advised to use the service lift. We didn't see the garden at its best visiting in March and actually looked quite scruffy but would imagine it would come into it's own in the summer. Once you get over the communal table arrangements the welcome from the hosts was warm and the wine list short but decent. What frustrates me about these places is the limited beer selection and the need to serve ""craft"" beers when a crisp lager would actually complement the food better. With regard to the food I felt the chefs were having a bit of a laugh with some of the food combination with for example a raw (poached?) egg in a fish stew which really wasn't pleasant. It a shame really as the concept is good but not executed as well as it could be. ",2
Gro Eatery,HFranck63,"November 2, 2018",Maybe just a bit too basic,When booking a table at Gro Spiseri you have to be aware of a few things.

This may either be super interesting or a total turn off depending on who you are sitting next to. The wine! I'm very much into wine (not as a sommelier but still) and the eco/bio wine was a serious disappointment. The taste and texture was all but exciting and didnt go well with the food. By the way - there is no a-la-carte menu so all guests are served the same food at the same time. Having said all that - big compliments to the chef for an excellent meal.

The evening we booked was vegetarian only, so the three courses were as such. Very good and tasty, and creative composition of organic and high quality ingredients. Only minus point was the serving size. Even for the main, which was a salad for us, this could have been up-sized to more of a true main sized serving.

Our stop at this restaurant was prompted by the amount of local Danish people eating. First problem was after we were seated. Two other tables sat down at the same time as us. They both received menus and service immediately. After 5-10 minutes I had to wave down a waitress to ask for help. After receiving our food I had to again ask a different waitress for spoons to eat our food. I will say that the food was good. However, as I reviewed the bill I see they charged me for tap water. I have traveled extensively throughout Europe and North America. I cannot ever remember a charge for tap water. This was especially surprising since we ordered 3 drinks and 3 entrees. I asked the waitress and she said it was normal. Since this is located in a heavy tourist area I feel this was just a way for them to make more money. ",3

For one thing, the menu has changed drastically and all their wonderful appetizers we enjoyed last year are completely gone... grilled scallops, shrimp on toast, really fresh seafood. Now, their appetizers are minimal. In fact, the whole menu is minimal. There were probably 2 salads, maybe 5 entrees, and some smorrebrod (Danish open Sandwiches). Husband picked the fish and chips, which was EXCELLENT. I ordered 2 items from the smorrebrod menu and they were both lackluster. The main ingredients (plaice on one, roast beef on the other) were quite good, but the sauce/remoulade were only so-so. Of course, I may be spoiled, since we'd eaten at Ida Davidsens earlier in the day and their smorrebrod were out of this world. Anyway, I think I would give the restaurant 3.5 stars, the service was excellent and the staff taking care of us were great. Bring back last year's menu.....and cooks!",3

The service was attentive and friendly and she helped explain the various dishes since we were pretty clueless. The atmosphere was dark and cozy, sort of a nice pub feel. It wasn't crowded probably because it was 4:45. We ate off the lunch menu (avail until 5) so we saved some money there. We had three different dishes and we all loved them. The prices ranged from about 130dkk-200dkk ($22-$34). Keep in mind that those prices incl tax and service so its not bad.

You certainly can't miss the big yellow building! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We saw the brunch plate on the menu (listed simply as ""Brunch"" and served until 2pm) and based on its description, we decided to share it. I am sure glad we did - it was huge! We couldn't finish it all, and my fiance likes his food, too! It came with a good-sized basket of bread, yogurt, croissant and jam, lots of fruits and veggies, cheeses, multiple meats (sausage, bacon, ham, salami), and delicious eggs and potatoes. The price of 125 DKK to share this plate was awesome too -- we've spent that amount easily on just one sandwich in Copenhagen and this was a very large amount of food! We enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant and location so much that we came back a second time a few days later. Just so you know, there was no wifi in the restaurant that I could tell (in case you are considering staying for a little to catch up on email or get online). The second time we came here we asked for some extra eggs (because they were so good) and our waitress was very accommodating in our request. Although we offered to pay more for them, were not charged extra and that is always a nice touch no matter where you go. :) I know there are some other good brunch places in Copenhagen but from what I could tell they were a little further outside of the city center or more complicated to locate. With this place being so centrally located and easy to find, Nyhavn 17 was a winner for us! Enjoy!",4

We ate these fairly quickly and left to be honest with you as the atmosphere was busy and stressful.

Tigermom,Morten H,"June 11, 2020",Innovative and authentic,"I would suggest showing up with an appetite and going for the full 6 course ""tigermom feast"" menu - actually it will be 7 courses because you will want to order a dessert once you hear what they are. There are typically both vegetarian, fish and meat dishes each completely unlike the previously presented ones, and if you are not a meat eater (but perhaps a pescetarian) it is possible to order the smaller 3 dish menu, which is still generous enough to feel full from. It is possible to add the chili pairing to the meals, and even though it might be challenging for some, it definitely adds to the experience. We have visited the restaurant once before, not long after they opened, and it is clear the kitchen is not relying on routine since the dishes had been completely swapped out, so we are also likely to return in the future to see what Lisa Lov and co. come up with next.",5
Tigermom,Verotravelling,"January 11, 2020",Nice and cozy,"Very nice place, great design and interior. The staff is very friendly and the food very good. We had the 5 course meal and it was plenty.

Tigermom,morl8tr,"January 2, 2020",Fantastic! A real standout in a great food city...,"As I was in the middle of being startled by how much I was enjoying my second course in the 7-course ""Feast"" menu at TigerMom, a thought occurred to me: being a chef in Europe who was born in the Far East (as TigerMom head chef Lisa Lov was) could eventually be a huge advantage. There are so many more flavours to work with when you bring the Asian palette together with the Western one. Seaweeds, brines, fish flavour variations, etc. The food we had at TigerMom consistently drew on the full multi-cultural arsenal, and the result was incredible. It's Asian inspired, certainly, but this is not your standard green curry -- every dish was very creative and original. I don't think I've had such an enjoyable meal in a very long time. In my reckoning, it blew away a Copenhagen classic, which I also quite like and have always enjoyed, where I had eaten the night before. Not one course was a misfire. This restaurant adds something important to the Copenhagen restaurant scene. The service was awesome, very attentive; they explain a restaurant convention when you arrive, you turn the lid of your rice bowl upside down when you run out of rice, and that signals them to replenish it. They accomplish this pretty much instantaneously (with the speed and precision required by a Tiger Mom?). One innovation that I've never seen anywhere else: They offer a matching ""spice menu."" For just a little bit more, each course comes with a carefully matched spice to add heat to that menu item. None of the offerings really need the heat -- they are complete in flavour without the heat -- but if you like heat, and I do, this adds an entirely new and enjoyable element to the meal. The drink pairings (we went with the smaller one), were also very nice, mostly beers and cocktails. The pineapple shandy was a particular highlight, that went very well with the course it was served with. We had only one dessert, which we shared (we were rather full by the end of the menu), but it was great (sesame ice cream with some sort of crisp waffle cracker). Many people seemed to be ordering a sort of slushy dessert cocktail. If we'd had any room left for it, we would surely have tried that. Oh -- and by Copenhagen standards, TigerMom is quite reasonably priced. It's a little hard to get to, not near any of the new Metro stops (we took the 1A bus from Vesterbro); but don't let that dissuade you -- it is very worth the rather short trip. It's hard to standout in the Copenhagen, but this place definitely pulls it off. Give it a try.",5
Tigermom,preben k,"July 7, 2019",Great food experience - maybe on of the best in Copenhagen,"This has to be a must! Tigermom is one of my best food experience inn Copenhagen. Good location near Norrebro and small enough to be a cosy place. We went for the Tigermom feast and with Drunken Dragon for our boozy pairing. And we did not look back after doing so.

Really enjoyed both fish dishes (one was a kind of ceviche salad, the other a kind of grilled white fish in tasty marinade). The artichoke dish was also excellent. We added the spice menu to go with each dish which is a little bit of a strange set up in the way they do this, but okay in the end (charge extra for various spice pairings to add additional flavor to the dishes). Service was good as well and the food came out quickly with a good variety of types and flavors. We will for sure be going back. Only downsides were the rather loud rap music (too much ‚Äòf$@@ this and that for an upscale restaurant, even one with a hipster vibe) and the fact that they gave us a sheet at the end suggesting a tip. We don‚Äôt tip in Denmark - feels a bit like you are trying to add on a few (like the spice thing). While it was very good and we will be back I think, the price was on the high side for what was served and a tip would really not make sense both culturally and relative to the overall value.",5

This was our first meal in Copenhagen, and we had higher hopes. I can easily now relate that first you have to get by the sticker shock. EVERYTHING in Copenhagen (and throughout Scandinavia) is expensive. My wife & I both had the lobster soup which was like a very thin & light bisque with almost no flavor. I also had the herring plate Smorrebrod; and we each had a local beer. The bill was the equivalent of $77.00 US!

A great place to hook up with other out of towners and compare notes on what to see and what not to do. Everyone in my party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Service was a little slower than what we are used to in the US, but we weren't in any hurry so it was just fine.",4

It was fairly busy with locals (always a good sign) but there was a place for us in the corner inside- there was an option to sit outside under heaters with blankets. Although looking more like a cafe, it served food of a very good quality and price; about ¬£10 each which is good for Copenhagen plus a serving of bread. I recommend the smoothie. There was only one Waitress and she was great- even though it was busy she served everyone and was very attentive to us.

I‚Äôm talking he took a beer and a news paper and sat on the patio, turning his head backwards to stare at us through a window, changing tables and turning uncomfortably to stare again. He kept creepily leaving things on our table for us (definitely NOT just a kind host giving little free snacks).

On the first visit, we had scrambled eggs, bacon and toast at the same time as the chef's choice of three types of herring: pickled with onion, mustard sauce and fried & pickled accompanied by rye bread and salad. The second time we tried the warm liver pate topped with bacon (salad on the side) and a delcious chicken salad with bacon served on ciabatta. Both meals were both delicious and reasonably priced. We'll definitely be returning on our next visit to Copenhagen.",5

The menu didn't mention that the chicken is covered in a very thick batter that's impossible to detach, so if you don't eat wheat (I don't), order the beef!

We ordered our food painlessly and it was all acceptable, but nothing spectacular. But then, the waiters forgot about us... No one checked to see if we were OK, no one asked us if we wanted more drinks, no one cleared our table after we had been finished the main course for about 30mins.

While mercurial chefs are by no means unheard of, I personally had never heard this. F* bombs dropping every other word, screaming at staff (all of this happening in English). Not only do I find this a disrespectful and really counterproductive way to get the best out of your team, but if you decide to open your kitchen up so that your clients can peer in, I would think that you'd want to ensure that this peek in is a pleasant one.

Adding a glass of Shiraz and a large bottle of sparking water to the tab brought the whole shebang up to $107, which was a very fair price for what we consumed.",4

No frites were actually available, but they did have some quartered and fried potatoes that, while arriving unusually quickly, were reasonably tasty.

Selina Pizza,Tony L,"May 28, 2018",Two reasons to eat pizza,"We have been to over 100 countries and often choose a pizza for dinner. The best reason is because the restaurant has really unusual or great pizza. The second is because you are hungry, looking for something fast, and low priced. Selina fits the second reason. A few feet from our hotel we walked in, ordered, took it to our room, and the price was right. Yes, it is a bit of an overworked kitchen with some fumbles and not the best customer friendly atmosphere, but the pizza was as ordered, lots of extra cheese, and really reasonable by Copenhagen pricing.",3
Selina Pizza,SparkyTS,"May 28, 2018","Decent pizza, need to STAY ON TOP of order!","We were there last week, staying in a hotel (Bethel-loved it!) in Nyhaven. This is a very small pizza place, obviously getting most of their business from locals who order in ahead and pick up on their way home. The rest of us ... well, you can sit about 10 people in the restaurant, and they were served, as best as I can describe. However, we paid for a simple, take-out pizza to take back to our hotel (the Bethel) across the street, and I had to stay right at the counter for about 10 minutes to keep an eye on the pizza maker. He knew I was watching, the owner knew I was watching, and after our ‚Äúto go‚Äù order was bumped twice, he finally made my pizza. I did get a grin from the pizza-maker, and extra cheese!!!!",3

The burgers and pizza are delicious and a great value! We spent $26 for a small pepperoni pizza, a burger, and fries.

We waited 45 minutes before we got our first round of our order, and when ordering a second coke, it took half an hour to actually get it served.

The service however was not so good with a quite grumpy server. Rather than give your order to the server you had to mark your order on a tick box sheet with a pencil which was easy to do. We ordered a mixture of starters, duck, mains etc and I asked for them all to come together rather than in courses but was told there were 2 kitchens and they would come whenever the kitchens cooked things - in itself that was fine and even with an ordered dish missing we did have a nice time.

The menu card with the tempting photographs of different Chinese dishes looked promising. The tempura prawns as appetisers were okay but the prawns very pretty small in size. Then we ordered fried chilly chicken and vegetarian noodles in main course. The chicken had some strong pungent flavour overpowering all other flavours. When we asked the waitress about it, she was not able to communicate in English. The noodles were greasy without any other seasoning. Really a disappointing experience. ",1

We won't be going back after this visit though; a complete disaster! First we waited a long time before anyone took our order. Then my partner's starter came, and along with a starter they brought his main course too but no rice for it, and no food for me. We tried to catch one of the waitresses but nobody paid attention, they were just running around like headless chickens, and the main course was sitting and getting cold while my partner ate his starter. After 30 mins or so, still no food for me, no rice for my partner's food. Then a waitress appeared and brought incorrect dish for me. We sent it back and asked her to take the cold food from the table away and bring a fresh portion with rice, but she ignored the request. After a while she came back with another wrong dish. Meanwhile all the neighboring tables who arrived after us had already received their food, so after 45 mins of waiting we decided to pay the starter we had received and to leave. The waitress who took the payment from me was extremely rude as well; no apology offered, she only slammed the credit card machine in front of me with a bang and mumbled something in her own language.

Pricing is very reasonable, and some dishes certainly give you great value for money - such as veal with ginger and bamboo. Mao's favorite dish, apparently, was a slow cooked pork roast, which is very greasy and served in a plain brown sauce, but tasty in its own right. The dumplings are not the treat I was hoping - right from the freezer and more gooey and chewy than tasty.

I ate half the sandwich, hoping at least to make the most of the $30 by saving the other half for another meal, bad as it was. I was stunned when I asked for a ‚Äúto go box‚Äù and was told ‚ÄúThe kitchen won‚Äôt let you take food outside.‚Äù When I sputtered and asked for a bag or something to wrap the food in, the waitress told me ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any bags.‚Äù Now I know from experience that other restaurants in Copenhagen have given me a box to wrap my extra food and take it away. I was tempted to use the small cocktail napkin on the table to wrap the 1/2 sandwich and stuff it in my purse. But I decided it wasn‚Äôt that great a sandwich anyway and I left it behind.

Chopstix,World1972,"January 19, 2019",Four thumbs up! (thoughts from an American guy and Chinese girl),"Highly recommend Chopstix if you are in the centre city looking for super tasty Chinese cuisine. Prices are fair and the atmosphere is cozy. I had the double-fried pork, black pepper beef, and some pork dumplings. All above par - though, if you are an American or from Asia, you may want to request them to up the spice factor a notch or two (they will happily comply :). In fact, i would like to state that it can be tough to find a good ""double fried pork"" in Europe. So was super happy. Will most definitely return (I conveniently live around the corner :) and order those dishes again and try some new ones. Great experience.",5

And we got beef instead of chicken in chicken tikka masala. Can you imagine this??? The bread we ordered was not crisp and fresh at all. Probably they used some old bread cooked even 2 days ago.

The dining card is bulky as it is traditionally in Indian restaurants. the sweet waitress asked if we would have the steak or less strong main course. I ordered a strong Shahi Lambert korma. it tasted fine, there was plenty and fine rice, but it wasn't really hot. 9g certainly not hot.

Shahi Restaurant,KatieViolet6,"April 3, 2019",Horrible!,"I visited Copenhagen this weekend and fancied some Indian food with my friend. We came to this restaurant hoping for a lovely meal but it was the exact opposite to that. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with rice and garlic naan - all of the dishes were really terrible. The dishes all came out around 4-5 minutes after ordering which was very alarming - Indian food should not arrive so quickly as it shows very little effort had been made and suggests that it's unlikely that any of the food is freshly prepared. The curry was soaked in oil and the chicken was very dry. The rice was severely overcooked and the naan was clearly from frozen and had been toasted in a toaster. I have eaten in many fantastic Indian restaurants at home in London and this restaurant came nowhere close to the standard I am used to. If you are in Copenhagen looking for a good tasty Indian restaurant / cafe I would definitely recommend Cafe Munk - please go here instead of this awful restaurant. The service, however, was good and the only lady serving was very kind and polite. The restaurant itself seemed clean and tidy.",1

If you have a small appetite and decide to have a takeaway then I would suggest you share the main course and rice as you get a massive tray of food. I can't say if it's the same as a eat in course as we haven't tried it. But you can always check out someone else's to see the amount.

Shahi Restaurant,589MichaelP,"August 9, 2013",Unpretentious popular restaurant,"A bit of a ""curate's egg"" - good in parts. This is clearly a popular place and booking is recommented even midweek. A big plus was that the staff were were aware of the difference between dishes that were toned down to suit local tastes and the wish of some guests to have something a bit spicier and we were asked straight away as to how hot we liked it. The main dishes were very tasty indeed. However, the papadums were not crisp despite it being really busy and the nan bread looked as if it was pre-bought and re-heated. The waitress was helpful and pleasant but clearly struggling with the number of guests. The restaurant was fairly basic but tables were left uncleared for longer than could otherwise be expected.The price was perfectly ok for the quality. I do not agree with other reviewers that it is not worth trying, I have have far worse attempts at Indian food in K√∏benhavn but equally there are places offering a higher quality and better ambience but with a price to match. The portions were of a good size.",3

More over despite being so late in serving, the food was so disastrous that half of us did not eat. Not a single dish was cooked like indian cooking. All spices were wrong and everything half uncooked. Chicken tandoori was halfcooked chicken leg with no spices but just the red colour. Lassi was a glass of skimmed milk with 1 spoon sugar. The watress were extreamly arogant and rude. Nan was just a pitabread. PalakPaneer was badly smelling and chickrn and lamb gravy were as sweet as a dessert !

Anyway...... my husband's panino was rather tasteless, one double espresso came in one cup and there was no sign of change. I went to the counter to get a second cup, to decant some of the coffee for my husband. I was handed a dirty cup. I pointed this out and was given another one - this time badly stained! By the time I eventually got a clean cup, the coffee was cold! I then asked for a receipt and my change. I think by this stage, the guy, who was a bit surly right from the beginning, was a bit annoyed with me. No receipt and too little change (in my opinion!), given the fact that my husband didn't even get the americano included in the breakfast deal. I was so frustrated that I flounced out, saying I would be writing on tripadvisor (tripavoid!) ",1

The table was dirty as we sat down; and the waitress did not even acknowledge our very existence. After FIFTEEN MINUTES of sitting, I approached the bar in a calm manner to place our order, as I wondered whether it was in fact table service. Spoiler alert: it was SUPPOSED to be table service. The waitress seemed distressed and annoyed saying she was going to be over in just a moment. After a further wait, she did not come and take our order but rather wiped the table next to us. As she walked past, I politely asked if we could please order. She told us we could but they no longer had any croissants or paninis left at all. NO PANINIS AT 11AM? We were very distressed. Upon hearing this news, we left to search for somewhere else to eat feeling rather deflated.",1

The prices were very reasonable, which was quite appealing in an expensive city like Copenhagen. The one waitress was busy and we had to ask for coffee refills a couple of times before receiving them. Later that same day, upon returning from our tour, we stopped in at Mambo and had pre-dinner cocktails.

The other dishes that we tried included the yogurt pots and the crossaints. The coffee was very nice but strong. The orange juice on the first and third day seemed freshly squeezed and very nice but on the second day it tasted like it was out of a bottle so I'd say that it's a bit of luck if you get freshly squeezed. The first and third day we had a very friendly and smiley danish waitress with great English. On the second day we had a different waitress, she was neither friendly nor smiley and slightly aggressive. To be fair she was stressed to the gills as the cafe was very busy and she was the only waitress working. Except for that the food was great.

Fun concept of sitting by the sushi belt and chosing either sushi or chinese warm dishes. I tried a single - uninteresting - piece of chinese pork. For the rest, we ate plenty of small and decent sushi dishes: different types of rolls, salmon and tuna nigiri, edamame, and orange slices.

Wine of the House was bitter and cheap to the bone. 235 kr For one bottle. I wouldnt even have payed 40 kr for it in a supermarket. The starter salad seemed randomly put together and despite the balsamico vinegar it had no real connection to Italy at all. The next course was ravioli in a sauce of cream and leek. Actually quite alright and the most well functioning course of all. However the upcoming main course of beef fillet potatoes and yet another heavy cream sauce punched us in the bellies and made no sense at all. Potatoes typically Danish and the sauce incredibly borring. Plain lazyness from the chef this one.. The finishing creme brulee was ok but third course in a row with too much cream involved. And then again Creme Brulee- in an Italian restaurant - come on! Tiramisu or Panna Cotta would have fit so much better. By no means recommendable !,2

The meat is good. But the veggies are obviously low quality. Tomatoes tasted like fish - probably because they are of the spanish greenhouse tomatoes that are fertilized with fish meal. I paid without conplaint because the restaurants are struggling through corona as everybody else. I like to support my local businesses.

I don‚Äôt think my experience would have been the same if it were not for the man working, Daniel (I believe his name was). Not only did he help me navigate the ingredients in each dish, he did not make me feel bad about needing his help! He was so willing to help and made sure I had the best experience possible! And he did just that! I continued to see how he treated each customer with kindness and maintained patience with the more difficult ones. 10/10 for WOK, 11/10 for overall experience!",5

I don't know if all Thai food in Europe is this good but this was so much better than any Thai food in Boston. Pretty cheap, pretty quick and open late. Not a must visit, obviously, but if you're in this area and need to grab something I would recommend it.",4
Wok'N'Roll,48Cruiser,"September 22, 2016",Thai-licious Dinners at a Hidden Gem,"This relatively new Thai restaurant is a few blocks off the main restaurant row and easily missed because it sits adjacent to a much larger eating establishment and has just a few tables inside and only a few outside. But take the time to find it because the food is simply delicious and is a good value, whether you eat in or take out. We ate there two of our five nights in Copenhagen and left happy with full bellies. One night we dined on Pad Thai (fried wide rice noodles, egg, seasonal vegetables and chopped peanuts) and Gaeng Kiew Wan (green curry, coconut milk, Thai eggplant, chili, bamboo shoots, long beans and basil). The second night we feasted on Gai Pad Met Mamuang (fried chicken with cashew nuts, spring onion, bell peppers, pineapple and chili paste), and Ped Teriyaki (crispy, fried chicken in home-made Teriyaki sauce with peppers, carrots, onions, broccoli and sesame seeds). The chef is one of the owners and she will prepare your item to meet your specific tastes -- just ask!",5

As a benchmark, it is near the Tyco Brahe Planetarium but on the opposite side of the street. It is also maybe a 10 minute walk from Central Station. Don't come expecting a meal however.

It was a bit unclear judging from the menu wheather the burgers included fries or not, so we ordered them in addition to the burgers. This was obviously a mistake and fully on ourselves as we then ended up - eventually - with a whole lot of fries. It felt such a waste and we felt that somehow the waiter should have clearified with us that we actally wanted all of that fries. Anyways, this was the least of our problem this evening. After 35 minutes we had to go and ask for an ETA for our food. The waiter said it would take another 5 minutes as they had a lot of orders. Looking around the restaurant and terrace we only spotted 3 or 4 other tables having pending orders at that time - with an adequately staffed kitchen it should really not be a problem.

Being busy is good - so long as you have the staff to cope. I have no idea what was taking place in the kitchen the evening we were there (02/04/15), but something was clearly not right. Our starter of bruschetta was very nice and came within ten minutes. And that was where it all went wrong. Basically, the poor waitresses (only two) were run ragged. Our main course, when it came after waiting 50 minutes was wrong and luke warm. We'd waited so long, we ate it anyway. We had to enquire after our drinks three times, twice. Meanwhile, some kind of drama was unfolding. Our waitress was seen being escorted out of the kitchen and told to sit on a stool and we noticed her finger was suddenly bandaged and bleeding. All in all, it was a great shame, because the food wasn't bad, the ambience good, but we'd obviously stumbled in when something was going wrong. If you're the owner, here's a tip. People are understanding - all you had to do was explain whatever the problem was and we'd have been fine. Making people wait for nearly an hour for the wrong, cold meal is unfair and wrong - we weren't even offered any kind of recompense, such as ""we're sorry your meal is late, have a drink on us"", nothing. It was embarrassing and we felt sorry for the staff. We didn't bother with a desert - it was so late and we didn't want to pile on more agony.",1

The Vitello Tonnato was a small dish, but with the homecooked Forcacia bread it was ok.

I felt sorry for the poor waitress who had to wait on everybody inside and then run up a flight of stairs to wait on folks outside.The budget conscious management should realize that this has an effect on service as no one can be in 2 places at once. The prices seemed moderate. I ordered a Fish and Chips dinner but was disappointed. I got something that looked like 2 tiny garnished Mrs Paul's frozen fish fillet(see photo) with some mustard and dried up French Fries. I hate getting a bad meal in a place like this. It is more than a bad meal it is a missed opportunity. I was only in DK a few short days and did not return to Nyhavn. After a long wait for the check I left and cannot recommend this place to others. I hope the management realize there is more to a restaurant than profit.

When we paid, she charged us for the more expensive pork - that we never got - and did not believe my partner when he pointed that out.

I asked if salad could be served on the side extra, as I knew they serve it on their lunch menu up til 1700. (We were there 1900) Answer no. OK, so we chose the item that has some veg mentioned on it, but when the plates come out we were actually dumbfounded by the small portions. Literally 4 baby potatoes 'artistically arranged' on the plate and a cold piece of salmon perched on a low mound of julienne veg not more than 10 cm across. We finished it in 5 minutes and left. This cost 210 DKK per portion. I am sure this restaurant is not alone in all the ones that line Nyhavn, as they all look the same, but this is the one we unfortunately chose. Obviously they rely on passing trade, but visitors to Nyhavn should be aware. It's pretty but it's just a tourist trap.",2

We came across an empty table for five at this restaurant and decided to stop here. On the park‚Äôs website, this place refers to itself as ‚ÄúTivoli‚Äôs classic cafeteria.‚Äù I guess they call it a cafeteria because there‚Äôs no wait staff, and instead you order at the counter (there was a line when we were there), and they give you a buzzer so you can pick up your food when it‚Äôs ready. Although they were busy, we probably had our food within 15-20 minutes. They offered sandwiches, steaks, cakes, and had an children‚Äôs menu, but also had a selection of beer, wine, and hard liquor. I had the deep fried fish fillet, while my wife had the schnitzel, Both were crispy on the outside and tasty, and came with French fries, which were also good. Each of our entrees was about $22.50 USD (139KRR). I‚Äôm sure we could have found something cheaper, but it was a memorable meal and it was nice to dine within sight of the lights on nearby Tivoli Lake.

After a few rounds of drinks elsewhere we wandered into here in search of a late dinner (around 10.30/11pm). We were placed at a cosy table on the far side of the bar. Walking past saddle bar stools was an amusing touch to the theme of the place. We were immediately handed menus and asked if there was anything we wanted to drink whilst choosing what we wanted to eat. Red wine (a gorgeous merlot was suggested), a glass of water each (4 of us) and one of us present (a local) asked for a shot of akavit for each of us. These were brought over in that order allowing us plenty of time to ask questions about the food. The waitress serving us was very friendly and very helpful! Friends went with a traditional dish of pork with parsley sauce and boiled potatoes, whilst I went with a steak and vegetables (option of fried or baked potatoes - chose to go with baked). The pork was beautifully cooked, the sauce was light but flavourful. My steak was done to perfection (medium rare), the seasonal vegetables were fantastically made and potatoes cooked to perfection. We were checked on halfway through our meal and promised further assistance if/when required.

She was served slices of what we would call thick sliced bacon the size of pork chops that so hard and dry it could not be eaten. I ordered the fish dish that was highly salted and was also covered with coarse salt! My wife did not (could not) eat her dinner and since we did not see our waiter after ordering, I managed to navigate mine. When our waiter did appear we mentioned the issues and he said he would let the chef know and left us the check. We paid it and left. We then headed to a nice caf√© to get dessert as this was all my wife could stomach and to dilute the intense saltiness in my mouth.

So we went in and were showed a table that we didn't like as it was maybe 1,5 m away from the door, right in the way of cold air that would blow over it if somebody entered. The waiter demanded explanation why we wanted another table, muttering something under his nose, but lead us towards one of the tables at the back. We were reading the menus for a good while as the light there is very dim, and then we enquired about the National Dish that was advertised outside in the window. We ordered wine and beer in the meantime. The National Dish arrived and we looked at it in disbelief - it was just a pile of deep fried pork belly slices, with new potatoes and a few slices of pickled gherkins. The two sauces that came with the dish came from a packet and weren't even properly hot, so weren't the plates and everything was cooling down fairly quickly. The sauces weren't seasoned so weren't potatoes. The white version was as thick as glue. We were hungry so managed some of the food, leaving most of the hard, fried to death belly slices. On our way our we saw many customers munching the same dish. Probably only because it's the cheapest item on the menu, although equivalent of ¬£20 per person should buy something edible!!!

The restaurant is spectacular value for money compared to other meals we had in the city centre. OK it is not refined, but it does taste like home cooking - and we all enjoyed our meal. The waiter was friendly and attentive, and gave us good advice about the menu etc. For my taste, the belly pork slices were a bit overdone - though very flavoursome.

We were told that that this restaurant was frequented by politicians and were shocked when we walked in because it was an interesting place to go. Taken right out of the wild west with saddle bar stools and American states branded into the log cabin decor. Overall, would I recommend it? Hell, yeah! They have a bar filled with wine and beer and spirits. Please also get the shrimp cocktail as it is not the typical American style and worth a try. Very Scandic!",4

I realised that I had only been here at the end of a long evening of drinking at which point the leather saddles surrounding the bar seemed to make perfect sense, or at least elicit a giggle followed by a, ""huh""? The rest of the place follows a hard core western/cowboy theme which is quaint in and of itself, except that the menu is almost exclusively Danish classics like deep fried pork belly and ""hakke b√∏f"".

So half hour in we finally had water atleast 30 mins later we got two pieces of chicken. We waited for another 10 mins and we got another small part of our order. I understand if the restaurant was full to wait but we ended sitting there for two hours and had basically no food. In that time we saw three other tables get up and complain about the wait after they had the same experience as we did. At this point we got up to leave and talked to the waitress which then tried to have us pay the full price after none of our food really came to us. She talked to her manager and we got half off which is more then we should of paid for the quality of the two pieces we got to eat. Would not recommended",1

Tryk Bar ApS,briosk,"June 15, 2014",Chill local bar with hipster-esque US theme,"This amazing bar is definitely not a tourist location even though it's just off several of the main tourist thoroughfares. The bar has a lot of americana on the walls but it's definitely not a ""theme"" bar and it's almost understated vice coming off as TGI Fridays. The place is packed late in the week and on weekends, with minimal actual seating. I would say it's almost like the Danish bar equivalent of Amsterdam or Vienna coffee shops - a location where decent sized groups of people go to talk about everyday events. The physical bar is actually quite small so don't plan on pulling up a stool and people watching. As for the drinks, it's got the typical Danish beer selection on tap, with a few roving taps depending on the season. There's actually a solid import selection for bottled beers, including some US staples that you wouldn't expect to see in Denmark. The bar food is decent. They have some seasonal drinks. I was there during christmas and had an amazing whiskey glug. I'd recommend it if you're in a decent sized group. But be forewarned, this place likely won't tolerate your typical group of rowdy 20-somethings that you'll get away with near Stroget.",4
