From the moment we arrived, I felt welcomed by all of the staff waiting the tables, they smiled, asked how we were doing and in general showed a lot of concern for our wellbeing. The food is Excellent. I can most definitely recommend the ribs. And they serve them with a small paper bag containing a pair of disposable gloves so that you don't get your fingers all messy. Why has no one (at least what I know of) thought about that before? Besides, the bag is perfect for the leftover bones. But those ribs! So tender, so yummy. PERFECTION!

Serious value for money,"Me and my boyfriend loved everything about our visit to Maple Casual Dining in Copenhagen. We ordered three courses; starter, main and dessert. It didn’t take long for our food to arrive and the timing was perfect between courses and also perfectly cooked. All of the flavours were there in every dish. We felt so welcome from start to finish. I would like to thank Will from Canada for making our visit the most positive. Everything was on point; from the service, the food, the ambiance and overall experience. It’s outragous that we did not pay more than 690 DKK for two starters, two mains and two desserts. Also; the waiters told us a little bit about every dish each time we were served.

Unfortunately, the curries, gravies and other sauces of this kind of Asian cuisine can quickly overpower other ingredients when executed poorly, but there was none of that here.

All were served as ( fairly) small plates. The star was the jerusalem artichoke soup, underpinned by a rich and reduced chicken broth and well married with smoked bacon. The texture and silkiness were on point - It was a very well judged dish. The initial plate of two langoustine with a crunchy salad was very fresh but not so memorable. The fried pike dish appealed - well it was fried - but not outstanding. Then for the (17) Danish cheeses plate. The owner / waiter had warned us to gird our loins. It was interesting and fun - but a little unnecessary and we would have preferred larger portions of 3 or 4 of the examples that we really liked. Pacing was rather slow and the service teetered on the edge of intrusiveness - but it was just food enthusiasm gone to the extreme. The wine list is well considered.

We were lucky that the Norwegian head chef was also our waiter that night. We had the tasting menu. Everything was superb. Our waiter listened to our preferences and carefully chose 4 delicious courses with 5 wines. He bought everything to life with his descriptions and passion. It was an awesome meal. And at the end he gave each of us a hug as we left. A first for me! I hope you get the chance to go. ,5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,stevenu826,"June 2, 2019",Special Restaurant,"I celebrated my 65th birthday with my wife at Restaurant Krebsegaarden in mid May and our dining experience was exceptional. Due to the popularity of this restaurant I made reservations well in advance of our visit to Copenhagen. We decided on the Taster Menu that included five specially prepared courses with each course paired with a wine. Each portion was prepared to perfection and the presentation was outstanding. The owners, and chefs, Carsten and Mats, personally served us at our table and explained each dish and how it was prepared. The service was needless to say, outstanding! The restaurant, albeit small, has a special ambiance, is extremely neat and well decorated. I highly recommend this restaurant!",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,jamesriddiford,"June 1, 2019",Perfect evening! ,"I booked a table at this restaurant as a little treat for my mum and parter. We had a 5 course tasting menu with paired wines. Every course was delicious and wines perfectly matched. Scallops for the first course were the best I have ever had. We also had the fish soup, hake and pork and couldn't fault anything. The 5th course I had a cheese board that consisted of 17 different cheese, don't worry they were really small samples of each and again perfectly paired with dessert wines. There was a Truffle brie that will change your life. On top of all of this the owner and waiter made you feel completely at home providing a warm and engaging evening. The whole restaurant was booked out so book in plenty of time. Prices were very reasonable for what you got, I have paid a lot more for a lot less. Do yourself a favour next time you're in Copenhagen treat yourself to a dinner here. ",5

They explain how all the dishes are made in detail and are very accommodating with requests (I’m pregnant so need to adjust my diet slightly right now). They chat with you and make you feel like you are having dinner amongst friends. With only 30 seats in the restaurant the atmosphere is cozy almost as if you were eating in an apartment.

The food was exceptional but the service was even better- attentive without smothering. Having the owner greet you at the door (he basically had to flag down the taxi that didn’t know where he was going) and be sure you got a ride as you left is just unheard of service.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,NPchicago1,"June 5, 2018",One of the best dining experiences you'll ever have!!!,"Well overdue in writing this review, but almost 6 months later, my wife and I still cannot stop telling people how unbelievable this meal/dining experience was during our visit to Copenhagen!! We have dined at numerous Michelin rated restaurants (including ones in Copenhagen) yet this place basically outshined them all! Every course here was so rich with flavor and the cheese assortment for dessert that everyone else keeps writing about fully delivered!! And as incredible as the food was, the meal was elevated to a whole new level based on the cozy, homely feel of the place as the hilarious Norwegian co-owner chefs basically become your new best friends as they serve the meal and come hang out, sharing personal stories and simply entertaining throughout. Would fly back to Denmark simply to eat at Krebsegaarden again (and again)!!",5

The hosts will dip in and out of each table conversing about the dishes, and this made for a very enjoyable night for us. My wife and I ordered the Bacalao (which was excellent) and we had a very informative discussion about its origins (my wife is Portuguese and I am Spanish, so we are very familiar with Bacalao, but where surprised to find out that salted cod originated in Norway). Compared to other restaurants, this one was not expensive either, which in my view makes this restaurant not only value for money, but you will also experience superb food and ambience. We would definitely come back next time we are in Copenhagen. This restaurant was one of the highlights of our trip to Copenhagen.",5

It was paired with a lovely light red wine from Spain. The owner visited our table after every course, and we were made to feel like family. We ended our meal with two different desserts, which were both fabulous (Creme caramel and chocolate marquis with berry coulis).

We were not disappointed! Food was beautiful, tasty but not pretentious. Definitely save room for the cheese tasting at the end if they offer it. Their wine pairings were spot on as well.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,eveiel,"February 1, 2018","Amazing dinner, spectacular service and great value",Often when you go to a fine dining the restaurant you expect the food to be overly fancy and sometimes unnecessarily fussy. This place has the perfect balance. The food is unbelievably delicious but also has an element of familiarity to it. The portions are perfect sizes. The restaurant is run by he head chef who was charming and constantly talking to the guests explaining the food and wine with his extensive knowledge. The atmosphere was so relaxed and friendly. The Osso Bucco was especially outstanding as was the cheese board where you receive a huge selection of danish cheeses. So pleased we stumbled across this restaurant which I would recommend to anyone visiting Copenhagen. ,5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,carpediemgolfer,"January 30, 2018",Fantastic evening.,We tried the 6 course menu with wine pairing. The food was fresh and simple but of a very high standard and quality.

We tried the tasting menu which was straight-forward, not trying to make psychological statements like other gourmet menues and very delicious. Loved the cheese collection which was probably the best I ever had. You‘ll not leave this place hungry as the few hours tasting menu includes plenty of food in total. All that doesn‘t really matter much though as the experience was dominated (in the most positive sense) by the very good service and the comedian-level humor of the host. My guests and I will never forget this evening. Drop the mic - Krebsegaarden is in the top-3 restaurants I‘ve ever been to.",5

Mats and Caarsten were very welcoming and made us feel right at home. We opted for the taster menu together with the matched wines to go with each course. The food was exceptional and the wines were equal to the food. The stand outs were the fillet of veal with a jus the like of which I have never tasted before. The depth and flavour were outstanding. And the Cheese board consisting of 17 danish cheeses and 3 wines. We were in Mats and Caarstens company for over 4 hours but the time flew by.

Following a day of travel, we wanted great food and wine in a less formal setting. We couldn’t have been more pleased. Wonderful flavors and presentation made the food high on our list of recommendations for Copenhagen. One of the owners spent time with us, explaining the evenings wine pairings, how he came to be in Copenhagen and open the restaurant. We enjoyed the conversation, which added to the appreciation of the foods. Understand, this is not Michelin star level, but for the price you will be just as happy as if it were. ",5

I loved the whole experience; there were 3 of us and we opted for the Taster menu and left it to our wonderful host to do the choosing for us. We started with the Bergen Fish Soup, followed by duck with a delicious prune and port wine glacé, then Reindeer with a delicious Swedish turnip purée (there were Brussels which I tried but not a favourite of mine lol). Each course was accompanied by a wine pairing. We finished with the Danish cheese board, and some fantastic wines which really complemented them. Every dish and every glass was served with knowledge and passion! We spent 4.5 hours in the company of Carsten and Mats - thank you both for making it so special!!",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,oneworldtravelbug,"December 4, 2017","Excellent, barring a slight personality clash","My fiancé and I dined at Souls, Olive Kitchen, Kød, the Red Box, Krebsegaarden, Kødbyens Fiskebar, Cafe Gl.Torv, Le Sommelier, and Zahida while we stayed in Copenhagen for one week. This was our best dining experience of the week, barring one detail. Wonderful concoctions and friendly service most of the night. We ordered the wine pairings along with the 5 course tasting menu and everything was going along marvelously until i expressed, in my humble opinion, a dislike of the NZ Sauvignon Blanc. It not only was not a fine pairing, but exhibited notes of resin. I asked ever so kindly our waiter if he could replace this course with a Plan B, smiling and saying it just wasn't to my liking. For at least the next 30 minutes or so our waiter was more noticeably less friendly, while being overtly friendly to all others in the kitchen, and passed us along to the head chef for most of the remainder of the evening. Curious, but not deserving a one fewer star, I admit. The one fewer comes with a vocal and derogatory rant about customers who don't show after confirming their reservation and how he completely shuns them. This was loud enough and repeated enough that all diners could hear simultaneously. Bringing up the cons of owning a restaurant loudly for a the entire group, albeit small, to engage in and comment on is not my cup of tea. Great service, in my estimation, does not include the personal woes of the day being touted. Finally, by the end the evening, the less than happy server of ours acquiesced and doused us with his spectacular knowledge of Rums, which, when I asked for a 23 yr old Ron Zacapa, he scolded me that that was by no means rum, and by no means 23 yrs old. Since Ron Zacapa comes in several versions, how else was I supposed to specify? Anyway, those were mostly presented gratis, and I do appreciate the gesture. The chef also waited tables and was by far more professional and serious, which I preferred this particular meeting. He explained in painstaking details how each course was prepared, which I loved! BY ALL MEANS go here and dine. Do not let my review do anything but encourage you from this wonderful experience... but watch your opinions as they may be stifled.",4
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,MobileDane,"December 3, 2017",it IS catually really nice,"As a local, working just around the corner, I wondered for some time why Krebsegaarden has had these high ratings at Tripadvisor for several years , as it is not particularly well known or hyped among fine dining Copenhageners. Until I finally got a chance to visit with my wife recently and we had such a lovely night. The food was really excellent ned beautifully presented, super wine pairings, and the most attentive and relaxed service by the two Norwegian guys running the place. Ads to that very cosy surroundings and interiors and your are bound to leave the place with a very good feeling in your hart and your stomach. There is not too much space (do they even have a wardrobe?) and the style is not french elegance, but just very pleasant and pretty. It is the good personality and excellent skills of both chefs and waiters that rally makes this place worth visiting. Krebsegaarden is usually booked solid many days in advance, but we were lucky this time to get a (the only) walk-in table. So you may try your luck, but don't count on it.",5

Wow! What a fabulous evening. Thank you guys, can’t wait to come back...",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Morris G,"November 27, 2017","Wine, hosting and food in that order - but still interesting",The hosts are lovely and engaging and I did not mind the detailed descriptions of the food. The wine recommendations were excellent. They are knowledgeable about food. The food was quite good but the baclao had an over reduced sauce and the crayfish in the signature salad was chewy. The 15 cheese course with three excellent wines was OK but less and a non blue cheese option would have made this the course to have; the cheese samples are too small to appreciate. Not cheap. ,4
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Lena E,"November 22, 2017",Amazing experience!,Very good food and and excellent choice of wines.

I was initially nervous as my husband is a strict vegetarian so I emailed the general contact email asking if there would be vegetarian options for their daily menu hoping for the best.. When we got there we quickly realized that our server (also the head chef!) had gone above and beyond to create an entire tasting menu based on his restrictions, which was more than just the normal dish minus the meat, but of truly thoughtful and delicious vegetarian dishes. The chef said he had spent the entire day planning out the vegetarian options for our meal and I don't believe he was exaggerating. It was phenomenal. As for myself, I had the un-altered tasting menu and it was the *best* meal of my two week trip. The wine pairing was incredible as well, including unusual and delicious glasses with each dish.

First Mats and Carsten the owner/chefs are amazing. Truly incredible hosts (they tell wonderful stories, share their passion of food, art, music and Copenhagen and make the evening memorable). Second the food is nothing short of spectacular. They are masters of perfect sauces and taste combinations. The mussel soup and the lamb were awe inspiring. Third they pair wines perfectly. We did the six course chefs menu and wine pairings all were spot on and very different. It was like a world tour in one room. I need to repeat how engaging and authentic the owners are. By the end of the evening, we felt like we had made new friends. They even arranged for us to get tickets to the F.C. Køpenhaven opener and told us how to get there on bikes (wonderful). If you are a foodie, this MUST be on your list. If you like meeting interesting people and getting great stories, this MUST be on your list. If you LOVE evenings where you go to dinner and four hours later you are still having lively conversation, lingering over great coffee and after dinner wine and wishing you could do it again the next night, Krebsegaarden must be on your list. We had a great five days in Copenhagen and the very best part of it all was dinner he ",5

The food was the best in Copenhagen but what made it was the helpful friendly and flexible service. This is a small place so you need to book.

However, after a phone call with Mats, one of the owners and general dogsbody, informed us of the availability of the private dining room downstairs, upon the condition of ordering a tasting menu set for the table. This suited our purposes (celebratory dinner for 5) perfectly. Upon arrival, we were shown to our table, laid out and prepared for our 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing. Surrounded by original artwork, the multi-lingual raconteur Mats and his equally friendly colleagues made us feel comfortable and welcome, and provided us with a range of delicious dishes. The wine pairings worked well. A list of dietary requirements was provided before our arrival, and the dishes were successfully adapted as required. The food was either spot on, or pushing some taste conventions: the soup was 'too salty' for some of our party, but just right, with a tremendously intense taste of brine exploding the taste buds, for others (myself included). Such reactions are, in my opinion, a good sign, meaning that we are being offered something new and interesting for our money. The various aperitifs and digestifs on offer were also exceptional, from the boutique limoncello through to some intense, memorable liqourice liqour which did indeed perfectly compliment coffee, as recommended. The evening was capped off by a round of well-wishing, hugs and handshakes, as well as a group selfie with Mats himself. Overall, a fine venue with excellent food and a relaxed ambiance, perfect for a date, a foodie, or a celebratory meal.",5

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,jjj637,"June 13, 2017",CONVIVIALITY & GASTRONOMY AT ITS VERY BEST,"During our short stay in Copenhagen, we had time to try only ONE of the many restaurants reputed for fine dining experience. After dining at Krebsegaarden, we had no doubts that we made the right choice. If there is one thing missing in most of the top notch restaurants that we have tried in many countries, it is conviviality and a relaxed atmosphere that is missing. In this respect Krebsegaarden was the exception. Mats Wergeland lived up to his stated philosophy of offering a ""homey & relaxed atmosphere"". This enhanced the culinary experience considerably. It was as if we were dining at Mats' home as his personal guests. Every dish and its paired wine was a topic of discussion and exchange of views leading to a greater appreciation of the qualities of the dishes and the wines. The tasting menu was a delightful combination of an ""a-la-carte"" selection and ""tasting"" portions. This was again a first for us. We chose the 'only sea food' route and every dish (brown shrimp in browned butter, cray fish salad, marinated red fish escabeche and bacalao), was outstanding.

Techinque, imagination, and wine pairings with equal flair!","Mats and Carsten really put their hearts and minds into the menu and wine selection. If you want to know what you are eating, where it came from, how it was made, why its inspired by the art show in the back garden, and what characteristics of the wine paired with each course is especially complimentary of the flavors - this is the place for you. I've never experienced such a high volume of quality information about cooking technique and the providence of the ingredients delivered with such a friendly enthusiastic and informal style as Mats and Carsten deliver with every dinner service. Clearly a place you could go 6 times a year and never be board. And be sure to ask Mats about where the rum comes from - that produces quite and enthusiastic lecture about distilleries and barrel aging techniques. Needless to say we had the best time enjoying a really high quality meal with a ton of info about every aspect. Last time we were so inundated with details was at Per Se in NY. And they were so nice about splitting plates as we obviously intended to share. And the downstairs ""party"" or ""private"" dining room looks like a really nice space to host 8 or 10 for dinner.

Each dish was beautifully created with the flavours exquisite. We were offered wine recommendations, but, I for example, don't like red wine, I was given a little to try, but said I would prefer white and I got to choose to continue with the wine I had enjoyed with the previous dish. I loved the crayfish salad, the cod in tomato was perfect, the slow cooked yet pink fillet of beef, was soft, juicy and melted in the mouth.

Passionate, informed, welcoming and did I say passionate? I initially thought the menu was limited but we discussed our thoughts and we went with a six plate tasting menu with associated wine recommendations. One starter, three mains (which was all of them) and two desserts. Well one dessert and a cheeseboard of 17 cheeses and three different wines. We stayed there for almost four hours. I have never tasted food and cheese like it before. Some mouthfuls were so wonderful we just looked at each other in utter amazement. Am scared to return in case it shatters the memory but am willing to find out.

The prices were included for each item on the normal menu which we thought looked very reasonably priced but boy were we in for a shock when our bill arrived. It was much more than we expected. Much more than if we had ordered a starter and a main from the a la carte menu. And for less food. We were not remotely full after having tiny tastes of 4 dishes. I think the quality of the food was superb but I do not think it was good value for money. Also for the wine pairings again there were no prices. And we were served the wine for each pairing so early that sometimes when the food arrived the waiter gave us a sip more wine so we could taste it with the food pairing but then he charged us very dearly for that extra tiny sip.

It was, however, a wonderful experience, and the reviews really don't do full justice to this amazing restaurant. The restaurant itself is tiny; simply. and stylishly furnished with only six or seven tables. We were greeted by Mats, who is a big personality and absolutely in his element when it comes to describing the food and explaining the provenance of each wine. We simply put ourself in Mats' hands and ended up with an amazing five course tester menu with matching wine pairings. The flavours were fantastic, with a beautiful crayfish starter, and a later serving of smoked eel being the highlights. The wines were equally impressive and Mats is clearly as skilled a sommelier as he is a chef. This is clever, careful, skilful cooking and every element is beautifully presented and each dish superbly balanced. Portions are sensible, prices are relatively modest for the quality of food and service ( our bill totalled about £80 per head including all the food, water, breads and five glasses of wine each). We also had fun here - there's a refreshing informality to the style of service, and the delightful sounds of laughter, along with plenty of sighs of culinary appreciation provided the soundtrack for a really magical evening.",5

The wine selection to accompany the meal was well paired an excellent Chardonnay from France, a pecorino, an Austrian red followed by a first class Italian red.

The restaurant is tiny and the menu small- delicious, but not a lot of choices. We went with the 5-course tasting menu and had the crayfish, very light and fresh, another starter; the bacalao, which has a lot of a very delicious tomato sauce; the turbot with horseradish, which I thought overpowered the fish slightly; and the ox which was also very good. Not sure I really got the connection between the food and the art, but the food was good. We appreciated the wine pairings and the enthusiasm of the staff/owners.

This was absolutely delightful and we followed this with the local fish called plaice which was a flounder very much in season and it was stuffed with fresh dill, thyme and lemon verbena and accompanied by smashed new potatoes with very generous amounts of fresh herbs and butter. We followed the suggestions of Mats on wine selections and they were perfect. Our only complaint was having to listen to a bit of a lecture on the state of the presidential election back home. This had nothing to do with dinner but was a bit of a downer to start a fine meal with. Because everything was exceptional I will let this go in my rating!

They even split out glasses of wine to pair with the meal. That in my mind is going above and beyond. That's before even talking about the food.

I recommend the tasting menu where you can select several entrees to try. The ambiance is cozy and is a perfect place to take someone special. The main reason we love this restaurant is that we think the food and service is good enough to warrant a Michelin Star. we consider ourselves foodies and if you look at my other reviews you won't see this type of recommendation. Their current menu features grilled trout, baba genouch, cold yoghurt sauce and dill potatoes, variation of guinea fowl with chanterelles and wild rice, Bacalao of the house (a very Danish/Norwegian dish).

We opted for the tasting menu paired with wine, and everything was prepared fantastically and had rich and deep flavors, albeit a bit saltier the I normally enjoy. One item that stands out was the first appetizer which was South German Onion Tart with Créme Fraiche Dressing and ""Windblown"" Pork, from pigs that live in a windblown area of Denmark and thus the lifestyle of the animal affects the taste. Although we did not have food allergies, I heard Carsten and Mats talking to other diners about the option to prepare their experience sans the food(s) that they are allergic to; they are to be commended for that. I've attached some pictures to this review. Next time we are in Europe, we will deliberately make Copenhagen part of our journey so that we can dine again at Restaurant KrebseGaard ",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,DebSB57,"July 17, 2016",The best restaurant ever,"We had dinner here last year and it's one of the reasons we had to return to Copenhagen this year. I made reservations as soon as they opened for the day we wanted to go. What a place! What an experience! We chose the tasting menu - 5 courses, 5 different wines, plus dessert. The content and preparation was described for each course, though briefly and not in a way that interfered with spending time with my husband. Each course, each wine was better than the next. And our hosts! What a pair. Carsten so charming, and Mats, telling us all about the music selections - we'd asked about them. He used to be a DJ and we would purchase his compilations were they available! Everything from local artists to Nina Simone, James Brown and the Beatles. Plus interesting art on the walls. And not nearly so expensive as you might expect. AND, when you leave, both Carsten and Mats meet you at the door, shake your hand and thank you for coming. We may have to return to Copenhagen every year.",5

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,lornasunshine,"July 16, 2016","Exellent food, excellent atmosphere - altogether a great dinner out!","We had thankfully booked a table at Krebsegaarden after coming across it on TripAdvisor a couple of months before our visit to Copenhagen. Lucky we did as it was booked up for months in advance. We were a little late arriving and had booked for the wrong number of people - even so we were made to feel incredibly welcome by Mats and his colleagues and our lateness was quickly brushed over. We chose the tasting menu with wine pairings which was exceptional - we particularly enjoyed that with every course and every wine either Mats or his colleague would take time out to explain exactly how the food was made and with what. The wines had been carefully chosen and complemented the food very well. One of our favourites were the shrimps to start. But by far the best bit was the cheese selection paired with 3 different wines - some of the cheeses were so different to anything we'd tasted before and 'oh-my-god' were they delicious. Mats and co were so so friendly and told us lots of great stories - they really made the evening what it was, despite being Manchester United supporters. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Copenhagen!",5

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,onzils,"July 2, 2016",very good quality food,This is a small restaurant and it´s very often fully booked. We were lucky as someone cancelled their reservation and we were able to go for dinner. We took a menu of 2 starters (half portion each) +2 mains (half portion each) + 2 desserts (also half portion each) with the accompanying wine (different for each dish=half portion) which was wonderful. This menu is not cheap but it is very good price-quality (especially for Danish standards).,5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,LadySneffels,"June 30, 2016",Lives up to the stellar reviews,"Without a clue as to where to go in Copenhagen, we followed TripAdvisor's advice and couldn't agree more with the rave reviews -- the dishes are exceptional, flavorful and well above your average dining. The service also far exceeds the ordinary, with the waiters taking the time to describe not just what we were getting, but providing intriguing details on the origins of the food and how it was prepared. The restaurant's location on a street with run-of-the-mill bars, etc., is very deceptive of it's exceptional quality and overall experience.",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Gesche S,"June 28, 2016",Highly enjoyable,"A most pleasurable evening in delightful company of hosts whose passion for excellent food and wine is palpable. The menu is limited but one can ask for several smaller first and main courses. We had the crayfish salad of the house and have never tasted such fine crayfish. We continued with the three main courses accompanied by the proposed wine, the different Danish cheeses, and finished with the petits fours which, I'm sorry to say, impressed me less. Altogether the evening proved a highlight of our short stay in Copenhagen and we will certainly come again.",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,SactoTravels,"June 27, 2016",Fantastic Restaurant in Every Way,"This is really a terrific restaurant in old Copenhagen and definitely worth the visit. While I was only there for a week, I couldn't help but go back for a second time. The service is impeccable and friendly. The food is all prepared with fresh ingredients and an absence of chemicals; they even forego common soft drink beverages for fruit-based organic drinks. Where it is fish or meat, the food was fantastic. The soups were divine. The flavors were robust and you can tell that they were intricately made and served beautifully. I couldn't rate a restaurant higher than this one.",5

It was fantastic experience and we would recommend it highly to our family and friends. The next night we ate at another top restaurant in Copenhagen and the atmosphere was lacking, food did not compare nor did the price which was more expensive than Krebsegaarden.

The menu is very small, but everything is really fresh and organic. They serve delicious homemade bread. As starter we chose the crayfish with a timbale-salad consisting of fruits and vegetables with a dill sauce. This was actually the freshest and best cray fish I ever had! Every course is explained in detail by the very friendly and attentive staff, they know their ingredients in and out. The bacalau as main course was delicious and very tasty, the red fish was good, but a bit boring. Very good creme caramel for dessert! The wine list is small, but all wines are well chosen and well explained. Overall a very special evening and it's really worth coming back!",4
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Monika M,"June 7, 2016",Excellent meal and conversation!,"We had dinner here our first night in Copenhagen and I had made the reservation about 3 weeks in advance.

I was stuffed and had difficulty finishing my last main course but my boyfriend was happy to clean up! The proprietor is always in the dining room, making conversation and suggestions. He has a sense of humor when it came to discussing the modern day dining scene! ",5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,ElliotinOhio,"June 6, 2016",You'll enjoy it as much as Mats does,"This might well have been the best dining experience we've had anywhere anytime. Mats, the owner, also waits on you and shares his good humor and love for great food. There's a limited menu of 3 choices for each of 3 courses, but Mats lets you choose as many of the nine options as you want as a tasting menu and the sizes are proportionately adjusted. We had two firsts [a radish salad; and a crayfish salad with delicately cubed watermelon and other fruits and vegetables; a lightly fried pike; and a pork-based main dish -- all of which were much more complex than I can describe, but Mats provided a detailed explanation. We added wine pairings which again could not been improved upon. But the highlight was yet to come: We chose the cheese plate as our third course and were provided 16 tiny samples of widely varying cheeses, with 3 more wine pairings. And 16 detailed cheese biographies by Mats: His infectious love of the food certainly added to our once-in-a-lifetime experience.

I was in Copenhagen with my sister and elderly father and I really had no idea what to expect but just wanted a really good meal. We were a little concerned when the area seemed off the beaten path and there is construction going on all around. But we decided to go ahead and give it a try - We are so glad we did as it is a meal that we will never forget. We did the 6 course tasting menu so that we could all sample a little bit of most of the menu. My sister and I also did the wine pairing with each course. Each course was a work of art and the flavors were incredible. And the wine pairings were perfect as well. Part of what made this meal even more amazing was our interaction with our server, Carson. He was a pleasure to spend our evening with and was attentive and informative. We would go back in a heartbeat.",5

Each item of food was extremely tasty in a subtle and pleasing way - we had the tasting menu. The presentation was a pure delight, with several interesting conversations with each of the Norwegian chefs. The wines that were suggested fitted perfectly. I cannot praise this restaurant too highly - they clearly care greatly about food and how to present it. The ambience is quiet, although the restaurant is small. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food, and less than one usually has to pay for this quality in Copenhagen - which makes you feel good when you leave. Booking is essential.",5

The home made sausages were particularly delicious. However, we were slightly misled by our guide book about tipping is optional and not generally expected. I added another 6% to the bill which worked fine in Paris, our previous destination. This did not go down well with the waiter who processed my payment. His face darkened noticeably and he did not utter a word as he finished my credit card payment. I can hardly remember any restaurant where I did not get a 'thank you' no matter how routine and Krebsegaarden was one. Looking back, the fact that almost everyone around our table were tourists explains how they reacted to a 6% tip. Spoiled by American tipping etiquette probably. I would still recommend it if you like over the top service and is willing to follow up with a big tip.",3

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,dee090,"August 30, 2015",Enjoyable,"We enjoyed our dinner but I don't feel it deserves number one on tripadvisor. There is a very small choice at each course. The bacalao was good but there was way too much tomato sauce with it. The highlight for us was the cheese plate which we shared & I do recommend you try this as a sharing plate. About 16 very small pieces of different cheeses to try. My husband had the wine pairing as well but he wished he had just had a glass of red to drink at his leisure whilst we sampled the cheese.. Service is charming & personal but perhaps it was just a little too 'controlling' ie we felt rather pressed into drinking the recommended wine, plus we were told to try the cheeses in a particular order,& to stop & wait before getting the next wine pairing to go with the next 8 cheese samples.

The customized tasting menu left us full and satisfied, but I'm glad I didn't pass on the amazing dessert! They are very knowledgeable about wine and provided spot on wine pairing recommendations. They are personable hosts who will make you feel like an old friend who has stopped in for a meal at their home. We felt totally taken care of while dining in their restaurant; the service was excellent and they take the time to personally describe every plate and every glass of wine they bring to you.

Mats offers wine pairings to go with each specific course - and the same can be repeated for the dessert cheese plate if you choose so.

The shrimp (real shrimp not prawns) in brown butter with incredibly fresh green beans was an amazing starter, and I followed with the bacalao, a Portuguese fish stew, with the most delicious concentrated tomato sauce reduced over two days.

I tried the cold summer soup which was refreshing, complex, and a welcome departure from the typical Copenhagen appetizers. Our main plates of veal with vegetables, and a sautéed redfish were exceptional. The overtly-earthy walnut pesto with the veal was the worst component of all but it was happily off-to-the-side.

Matt and Carsten are friendly and informative (they do like to entertain ). It is a small, intimate room. We met a nice couple from New York.

The menu changes seasonally and there are sufficient choices for all courses to satisfy most diners. The wine pairing suggested by Mats worked very well with the courses we selected.

Yes.....the staff and the service are second to none; their friendly engagement shows a real passion for their restaurant and you, the customer. Don't be put off by the price....compared to other eating establishments in Copenhagen, it is no dearer than anywhere else. The atmosphere is very relaxed & the standard of the food is very high. However, being told how much effort has been made in producing the dishes and how they have arrived at your table does not mean it is all wonderful. Some of the dishes have truly delicate flavours, especially the guinea fowl. But the creamy mussel soup is so intense & the tomato based sauce on the bacalao can be overpowering on the fish. I am sure everyone will enjoy their experience here but it's not a 'given' as a must return to restaurant.",4

We split 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts, along with wine pairings for all, and everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, was simply delicious. The dishes were complex without being distractingly so. The flavors popped. The presentation was flawless. Ditto for the service.

The wine pairing took it to another level and combined with the wit, charm, energy and enthusiasm of Mats and Carsten, we were bowled over. We had another reservation at Geist which we cancelled and came for a second dinner at Krebesgaarden the night before we all flew back to the U.S. AND IT WAS JUST AS GREAT.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Sardanapale,"June 20, 2015",Everything you've read is true,"This restaurant was the gastronomical highlight of our trip to Copenhagen. We decided to splurge and went for the tasting menu with paired wine. The price may sound a bit steep (£150, or 200 euros, for two) but I would recommend this formula: every dish melted in the mouth and was perfectly complemented by the accompanying wine (which came in generous quantities - and in fact a couple may consider ordering a single wine menu if one of the two is a light drinker). We were made to feel most welcome by the colourful owner, who regaled us with running commentaries on the ingredients and the preparation.

The 2 starters we tried, lumpfish roe & roasted chicken skin & the house crayfish salad were both gorgeous. The 2 mains were even better, a stunning beef tenderloin (with an unexpected opportunity to find out about burning love) and the dish of the night - the house bacalao, which goes down as one of my favourite dishes ever and nothing like any bacalao I've ever had. Even the dessert was a great one too, on paper not much, marinated pear with various bits & pieces, but spot on in the mouth in terms of tastes & textures.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Veteran_traveller041,"October 19, 2014",Very Interesting place to eat,"We went for a meal on the last day of our trip to Copenhagen following the advice of the Tripadvisor ""Number 1 position"" As stated i is a lovely restaurant run by a couple of eccentric Norwegian chefs. They took great pleasure in personally explaining in intricate detail how each course was prepared and were not short of self praise in their descriptions. In describing the salt cod in a tomato sauce the description included "" we use a ridiculous amount of tomatoes with a carefully chosen selection of herbs, mixed with copious amount of wine and then reduced over two days to concentrate the flavour"" It was OK but I couldn't taste the fish at all! This was rspeated for all the courses and , to be honest, it was a bit wearing. My wifes food was equally ""OK"" and equally florally described. Overall the food was good but, in my opinion, overhyped and, on a personal basis, I prefer less attention from the staff and let the food speak for itself. Did we complain, no having heard the chef's talk I did not really want to get into a long discussion as to the pro's and cons of their cooking.",4

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,amalcu22,"October 7, 2014",Fabulous Meal,Probably the best meal I've ever had. We have four courses with wine pairings. We had the blonde server (cant remember his name) who had a wonderful sense of humour. He made food suggestions and explained what was being served without being too overbearing. Four courses with wine pairings came to about $150CAD per person. In my opinion good value for what we received. One word of caution is be sure to make a reservation as they fill up about 2 weeks in advance and they turn away walk-ins.,5
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Ketil T,"October 5, 2014",Wonderfully different service and outstanding food,"The menues are inspired by the art exihibition in the same house. The owners wo are running the restaurant talk to you about what you should eat, and even how much (i.e. just want to taste or love that can I have a large portion) and recommend the right wine by the glass as a package in the same way - it just was a total delight. Beware - the place is popular, but being on the waiting list paid off. With only 10 table or so and only one seating per night the focus is on the customers and it was huge fun to experience that. I am looking forward to next time. ",5

But what makes this place special is the friendly Norwegian guys running the place. It is not a gourmet-restaurant like NOMA, Geranium etc. and there are after my opinion better restaurants in Copenhagen, but the atmosphere here cannot be beaten and the prices are a lot lower than you would expect. The tasting menu is a good choice if you want to try different courses. You do not have to take the full wine-menu. The wines from the menu is not more expensive if you buy them by the glass.",5

We had three courses and came out stuffed, as well as different wines by the glass, which were the recommendation of one of the owners after we told him the types of grapes we liked.

The food we had was lovely - I had the cheese tart to start and then the veal. Both portions of a decent size and lovely fresh flavours. The owner took the time to discuss the different wine options with us, my boyfriend prefers a lighter red whilst I prefer a heavier one, so it was agreed that rather than our usual compromising on a bottle, that we would drink wine that the owner had recommended to us by the glass. Good choices! The service was fantastic, both owners very knowledgeable and they really took the time to talk us through the menu.

They are not large portions but adequate enough to have a great taste. We did. Of do the wine pairings since we had jet lag or we would have crashed into our food. Service was friendly and such a great where Matts explained the preparing of each dish which was full of various spices and tiny cut veggies. I adored the rack of lamb and the crayfish appetizer. I had one glass of Pinto Grigio and Joe had two glasses of blood orange juice. The other people near us raved about the wine pairings. The cost was about $ 163 plus 5% tip which is customary in Copenhagen which we asked Matts. Great not to be missed if you want a taste of Great Dane cooking.,5

Our fellow diners all seemed to be having an experience like ours (ie outstanding) Would strongly recommend you book this in advance if coming to Copenhagen on work or pleasure as gets booked up (whilst there at least four couples who had not booked had to be turned away).

It is obvious that they take great pride in their friendly and courteous service. But of course that would not matter unless the food was also great - and it is. They have only 3 starters, 3 main courses and a few desserts. My wife and I did a tasting menu, where we sampled 2 of the starters and 2 of the main courses: a wonderful crayfish salad with a chopped fruit/vegetable terrine, a delicious cold beet and cucumber soup ,sauteed redfish with a scrumptious sweet potato puree, and 2 exemplary lamb chops on a rack with couscous and sautéed greens.

Prior to going we read all the previous reviews on Krebsegaarden and on this basis booked well in advance of leaving the UK. We are so glad we did as the whole dining experience was amazing. As stated in previous reviews the outside is unprepossessing and is like sitting in someone's sitting room. There are only about 9 tables and the effect is quite intimate. From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed. Again having read previous reports we opted to go for the taste menu and left all the choices, including the wine pairings to the experts and experts they were! We decided on 5 courses, the first the most delicious cray fish we have ever tasted, followed by marinated radish with goats cheese cream, then red fish with bell pepper vinaigrette and summer vegetables followed by lamb with tsatziki with tarragon-olive reduction and couscous. We finished this gastronomic feast with a fluffy Italian meringue ice cream with marinated berries!

We were not disappointed in any way. This is some of the most spectacular food I have ever had the pleasure to consume! The cheese plate with paired wines for desert was as amazing a desert as I have ever had. I won't relay the exact items for dinner, because it appears that menu change is constant based on what is available. Suffice to say that preparation and presentation were stellar. The following night we had a reservation at one of the Michelin starred restaurants in Copenhagen, and it was twice as expensive and half as good.

We had a most delicious skin crisped redfish with summer vegetables and pureed sweet potatoes that had a wonderful mouth feel when put all together. we didn't eat any dessert due to jet lag, and while the dessert menu was intriguing it was not a good fit for a person with nut allergies.

It is a small charming restaurant.. The chef /waiters are great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. However, even as they described the complex way in whcih tehy prepared the food.

Like a lot of European restaurants where there was novel and innovative mix of ingredients, this restaurant did it very well.

As a starter i had the crayfish salad, and the taste was very good, unlike any salad I have tasted before. My choice for main course was the filet og veal, another winner.

We asked the waiter to select the wine per dish and he did an great job. The menu is quite small but I think there is always something good for everyone. Menu changes monthly so watch out if you plan to pre-select something from the menu on the internet. In my case the menu had just changed (no problem though). Will try to go back here when visiting Copenhagen again.,4

The restaurant is a credit to the hard work and commitment of Mats and Carsten who enhanced our experience with their friendliness. I will always remember Mats for our chat about football and even more for his knowledge of Malt Whisky ! I tried one or two and came away with the names of some I must buy in the future.

With so much riding on it, we were slightly nervous, despite other excellent reviews, but our experience in this lovely restaurant matched up to all the positive comments made by earlier diners. The atmosphere was charming. It's quite small, but there is no sense of tables being crowded together nor were we rushed through our meal. In fact we spent an hour eating our way through the cheese board, having previously been introduced to each cheese and its provenance by Mats. I had the three wines to match the cheeses (fortunately small quantities rather than full glasses!) and that in itself was an experience and an education. A limited menu-but when each dish is perfection, why do you need more?",5

Totally unpretentious with some great food. I recommend ignoring the menu and just ask him bring you what he thinks is good, that way you get the tasting menu and get to try just about everything with his choice of wines too if you want.

I had the traditional Xmas cod dish with cod roe ...excellent ,but glad I chose the small portion. We finished with homemade petit four and tea with the bill coming to 679 kr - we didn't have wine which probably kept the price down and felt it was the best value for money meal that we'd had in Copenhagen.

I always find it impossible to take in the amount of information being given about the food I am about to eat, and something in me was saying, ""okay, fine, but just let me get on with it; maybe I can ask questions later"". In terms of interesting, balanced food, this place is better than many. Worth a visit, but don't go there if you are looking for a picturesque place, or an intimate meal. There were lots of pictures on the wall and in the basement, and the food is themed around the exhibition we are told.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,AlexS101,"July 26, 2013","Good food, enthusiastic chefs","We had many expectations before visiting that restaurant: after all, it is chosen to be Number 1 in Copenhagen by the Trip Advisor and has many good reviews. We made our reservation even before arriving to Denmark, while still in the US and were very pleased to find out that our reserved table was waiting for us. The restaurant is small and cozy like many other similar high-end restaurants in Europe. It is run by two Norwegian gentlemen that both serve as cooks and servers. We chose the taster menu, as we usually do in such places. The chefs were very enthusiastic to explain us every dish and wine served with it with a lot of detail. In short, any serious foody would appreciate such a place. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the sample dishes were rather small, for the price we paid, as compared with the similar places in other countries, and some of them were good, but not really outstanding. The really outstanding were the traditional Danish fish dish (bacalava - not sure about spelling) and ice cream desert. Perhaps the fact that we were in the company of other people that are not quite 'foodies' and have various demands (not too salty, no red wine, not too spicy, etc.) confused somewhat our hosts to make it a real dining experience. I hope to visit that place again with my wife only and truly appreciate it. Again, perhaps the quality of the food is much better than we perceived and I wish that next time they would serve a somewhat larger sample portions to truly appreciate their taste.",4

We chose a tasting menu with wine (based on TA reviews) and not only did we get a culinary/wine education, but we were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable (not inexpensive, but reasonable) price for such an indulgence. We live in a part of the world filled with wonderful restaurants, many of which we have visited, but Restaurant Krebsegaarden would give any of them a run for their money. We enjoyed an incredible variety of foods all paired perfectly with wines, and all inspired by the work of the artist on display in the gallery... How much better can it get than that!

We found it impossible to pick a specific dish from the intriguing menu and instead opted for tasting dishes. We weren't disappointed. Every dish offered something different, with the veal dish being an absolute highlight.

Food was great, but not over the top. Starter soup was a bit too salty and main course braised shanks were not quite melt-in-your-mouth. Chocolate dessert was average. However, having said that, you will have a really good time here and will be satisfied with the food, not blown away. Prices are excellent, considering the vast array of overpriced establishments in Copenhagen, and quality is good. We would return because it was a very fun evening and a nice place to be.

Excellent cheeseboard which I would recommend above the sweets. I had a well cooked pork tenderloin as main course which I would struggle to fault.

The value for money was astonishing, considering how much we were offered. Crayfish salad is particularly fresh and novel-tasting; then melt-in-mouth tenderloin with polenta, the house bacalao (salt cod in tomato sauce) and, best of all, skin-on trout with dill sauce and rosemary potatoes; creme caramel was delicious too. Our host is a joker and does a droll double act with his chef colleague; they both enjoy popping up and introducing the food and drink with infectious enthusiasm. There are very few tables and a calm and happy-making atmosphere. Reserve in advance, as they said they had turned tens of people away the night we visited.",5

It is owned and run by Mats and Cars (both Norwegian, I think). They do everything - waiting the tables, creating the food, and telling you precisely how everything is created. They were such nice guys, and spent time talking to us about the food, their restaurant, wines, etc. Most importantly - the Creole pork tenderloin was excellent, and so were the chocolates (petit fours) that I had to finish my meal. Their menu is created according to the art that's being exhibited in the gallery in the courtyard behind the restaurant. They have some of the art in the restaurant as well. In July, the artists are Cuban, thus the Creole pork. While pricey, it is worth every krone. It was an outstanding meal and experience.

The service was outstanding with both the waiter and chef chatting to all the guests and explaining the dishes in detail.

The owners were casual and friendly and we enjoyed interacting with them. We both had the pork tenderloin which was cooked to perfection, with an interesting and delicious sauce and accompaniments. As I am an enthusiastic cook, I picked chef Carsten;s brain and he was very generous and forthcoming with his original secrets. We would love to eat here again when next in Copenhagen.

I suggested we try Krebsegaarden our last night because of the reviews I had read on Tripadvisor. When I called to make reservations for 12, I spoke to the owner and he suggested a set menu since it was a large group in a small restaurant. After he listed a few choices, I decided on crayfish salad, a pork tenderloin entree and creme caramel. It was an amazing dinner. Both owners were there and suggested wine pairings while they entertained us with stories of their opening, including even some ghost stories. The sauces surrounding the entree had been simmered for 5 days. Every bite was delicious - one of those meals where you want to lick your plate. Even the bread was outstanding. Two of our guests asked for fish instead of pork and the hosts were gracious about the substitution. We ended up with 15 people instead of 12 - two of whom called to say they would be late - and everything was handled with grace and elegance. They had some interesting art on display from Lithuania in the dining room and in the lower level. Evidently they change their art display and menu regularly.

I had the Bacalao for mains and my wife had the plaice. Both were delicious. However, possibly the most impressive item on the table was the malt bread.

We had read the reviews on Trip advisor and were really looking forward to an interesting dining experience, we were not dissappointed. We opted for the taster menu, each dish is matched with wine, all the dishes were very tasty and the wine choices were great, we would have preferred a red with the cheese course, But Carsten asked to try his choice, we did and when one of us couldn't enjoy it he chose an apppropriate red. We found him informative and enthusiastic and not at all intrusive, we highly recommend this restaurant, run by a talented and enterprising young team!",4
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,travelbunny666,"February 11, 2012",I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant!,The owner who is the chef as well couldn’t do enough for us.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,bnbass,"January 8, 2012",Excellent! Restaurant with a passion for food,"We had our fair share of good restaurants around Europe but Krebsegaarden lifted the bar again. The two guys running the place have an obvious passion for food and you will be wowed by the tasterange hidden in a seemingly simple dish. For instance, the crayfish salad seems really straightforward but they've carefully placed and cooked each herb and vegetable so that in one bite you gradually encounter different flavours and thus bounce from wow to Wow to WOW. Even a potato & leek soup becomes haute cuisine once these guys get started. Meanwhile they carefully select wines adding character to the food (instead of being a means to swallow). Eventually the evening is topped off with a large selection of Danish cheese to be eaten in specific order and building to a grand finale. The whole menu tells a story and is carefully selected and with much love prepared. What a treat this place was. And for a price for which you only have an entree at Noma, Orangeriet or Geranium. It's a small place so be wise to make a reservation in advance.",5

And now I found it (at least, I hope I did). Great welcome and great entertainment by Mats. Carsten did his work in the kitchen and it was excellent. Since there was no set menu, I thought the evening would be limited to a three course meal, but it became much more. Every dish was accompanied by a great glass of wine (and in case of the cheese platter - 9 different cheeses! - even two different wines). Great experience and next time I'm in town, I'll come to check if they can hold this standard. Forget Noma (although I still want to go there), in Krebsegaarden it is much easier to get a table.",5

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,SC T,"September 16, 2011","Depending on personal taste, not up to expectation",The starter (risitto) was good in quality. But it was very salty according to our personal taste. The waitress actively asked for our comments and she reflected this point to the chef. Later main course (sole with pasta) for my wife was excellently prepared and the taste is right (not salty). However my main course (veal) was of average standard and was salty. The desert was good but not impressive.,3
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,pbm0,"September 6, 2011",For the unsophisticated only.,"If you know little about food and wine; this is the place for you. The owner takes personal interest in pleasing you; however, he knows nothing about food or wine. I ordered a fish dish in a red sauce. Thinking it was something like a cioppino; I asked him which he thought would be better: an oaky Chardonnay or a light Pinot noir/Beaujolais. He suggested a specific sauvignion blanc. I was hesitant, because sauvignon blancs are generally not sturdy enough to stand up to most seafood dishes unless they are relatively sweet. But he was adamant; so I ordered it. What a disaster! First of all the red sauce was primarily a reduced tomato sauce and totally overwhelmed the fish; and was the last preparation one would ever match with a sauvignon blanc. it was clear that he knew almost nothing about food or wine; but he is a great salesman and makes you think that he knows about food and wine. However, inasmuch as the average person also knows little about matching food and wine; his enthusiasm and likability has made his restaurant so popular. The food is of good quality and value; and so long as you stick to dishes whose preparation is familiar, and match those dishes with the wines that you know will work, in ridiculously overpriced Copenhagen, going to this restaurant may be justified.",3
Restaurant Krebsegaarden,AliDougal,"September 5, 2011",Excellent - as long as you're not a fussy eater,"We visited Krebsegaarden to celebrate my father's 60th birthday and we had a great meal. This restaurant gets the best Trip Advisor rating in Copenhagen (above Noma) and I can see why - the food is excellent, the atmosphere warm and buzzy and the service is welcoming and memorable. The co-owner and waiter (his name is Mats, I think) is a real character, and his banter made for an entertaining evening. The owners are passionate about their food, and everything was beautifully cooked and presented, and tied in with the current art exhibition theme (which, for us, was Greek). My only complaint was that my mother, who is admittedly a very fussy eater, was made to feel really uncomfortable because she asked for her meat to be well-done. They pretty much refused to do it for her, and as there are only 3 choices on the menu this resulted in a tricky and slightly embarrassing situation. However, everything else was impeccable, so I'd highly recommend visiting as long as you are not a fussy eater!",4

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,pnl1962,"August 22, 2011",Informal fine dining served by a genial Basil Fawlty .,"Struggled to find a restaurant that could accept a business/client Friday night booking for eight ( after scouring our safe bet regular choices). Happened upon this place after a desperate seach which ended with Trip Advisor. I dont habitually review, but in this case I felt obligated to put something back into TA. My clients and I were bemused by the fact that a party of only eight had to pre-order food from what was quite a limited choice in each section. However, lack of alternative forced us to play the game. We arrived and found ;a pleasant ,quite small , 25 cover restaurant with modern artwork hung ""gallery style "" around the room. We dutifully took our seats before the ""owner-chef-sommelier-waiter-raconteur"" burst on the scene regaling us with his tales of woe in the kitchen due to the Copehnagen water E-Coli situation. His bubbling enthusiasm and general rhetoric immediately set the table chatting which only stopped when he admonished us for disturbing his cheese lecture at the next table! Only someone supremely confident in the evening's progress would have got away with it. All of the above is only to set the backgound for what turned out to be a wonderful evening. The food was excellent, the cooking methods explained and the owner was given free reign to wine match the food. Again, he did this to everyone's satisfaction. No point in going into too much food detail as the menu changes monthly and an attempt is made to link the menu to the interests of the resident artist who is displaying in the room ( and attached gallery ) . Dont be put off by the limited menu.. as Basil explained... do a little , do it well and have less waste.",4

We had different dishes for starters as well as for main course and were all rated very good and even above end a couple of cases.

Last night was the big night, and I must say, this restaurant lives up to.....and actually surpasses.....the glowing reviews it has received here. The menu is select as many have noted....three starters, three entree selections, and three deserts. After realizing that my husband and I simply couldn't make up our minds, they actually allowed us to put together our own ""tasting"" menu. We each chose a different starter and then divided two entrees. I can say without reservation that this was one of the most delightful meals we have enjoyed in years. The selections are unique and creative; however, it's the staff that makes the whole experience so special. Our server, Sara, and co-owner, Mat, enthusiastically described every selection and also made spot-on recommendations for the wine pairings. Mat was kind enough to spend a considerable amount of time talking with us about the ingredients that went into each dish and the techniques used to prepare them.

""Ordinary homemade food,"" really? We shared the beetroot soup (75 DKK), crayfish salad (75 DKK) and bacalao (175 DKK). Nothing homemade about any of these, at least not in our home and my (third generation Danish) wife is an excellent cook. As noted, the chef/owner takes delight in explaining the preparation. The bacalao takes days to prepare. Another dish we did not try, red wine marinated wild boar, also takes days. The menu at this restaurant varies and now it is Lithuanian.Thus, the favored lamb dish was not on the menu. But the food we had, particularly the bacalao, a salted fish in a rich tomato sauce, was marvelous. There are small and larger portions on the menu, which allows you to adjust for portion preferences. BTW, the location is an easy walk from the train station/Tivoli/City Hall area.

The suggested wine was also very good, and the dessert cheese tray, with a variety of regional offerings, was an excellent finale.

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,BRAINHEART,"October 15, 2009",ART a la Carte,"I visited Copenhagen to meet my old Swedish friends who was relocated to Copenhagen two years ago. We also planned to watch the WC-qualifier football game between Denmark and Sweden at “Parken”. Friday evening Copenhagen had the annual “Art Night”- event and everybody was out to paint the town with happy feelings. We went to see the Grand opening of a great Lithuanian / Parisian artist Pranas Gailius at the Art gallery Krebsen. The artist has a mixed technique, linking painting, graphic art and collage together with engraved text in French. This makes the paintings very strong and spontaneous . Two days later we were back to the Krebsegaarden again, but this time to experience a gourmet evening from their excellent first class kitchen. There is a lot of TLC (Tender, Love & Care) from the owners of this art and food paradise on Studiestraede 17. A visit to Krebsegaarden is a must for the food and art lovers. My best compliment to the chef… MAGNIFICENT!!",5

It is a lovely little restaurant that is just far enough off the beaten tourist path to be a real find. The food was wonderful. The menu incorporates flavor combinations that are a bit unexpected, but not completely out there, and completely successful. The owners are wonderfully welcoming, as well, but not too much so. The atmosphere is welcoming, as well -- a classy casual feel, which the art contributes to nicely. Americans should be advised that this is a meal to be enjoyed over hours; the food is cooked to order and no one will be pushing you out the door, trying to get the seat filled again.",4

Restaurant Krebsegaarden,Dyova,"April 25, 2009","Unpretentious, sophisticated, delicious","This is a fantastic find, on a fairly quiet stretch of the old part of the city. The room is homey yet sophisticated in an understated way, and the art on the walls changes regularly since in addition to being a restaurant, this is an extension of an art gallery in the back. The chef's changing menu is inspired by whatever happens to be on exhibit at the time. You can choose small portions or larger-sized ones for each course (we chose all small portions and 3 courses were perfect). Each dish was prepared flawlessly; the cod (""Husets egen bacalao"") in particular was cooked to perfection. Don't miss the Danish artisan cheese selection for dessert: it was an adventure in 6 stages, and surprisingly enough one of the highlights of our experience. The two owners are meticulous about the service, decor, and of course the cuisine. It's obviously a labor of love rather than a commercial enterprise: you'll find no pre-cooked, reheated dishes at Krebsegaarden.",4

They told us in advance there was no kids menu but the chef would endeavour to make something to order if the ingredients were available. In the end we fed the kids elsewhere before we dined, though we were all made very to feel very welcome all the same, and our kids still LOVED the deserts, (chocolate cake with ice cream to die for, apparently!!!) As for the grown ups, our meals were excellent, and of very high quality, beautifully presented and well considered. The chef certainly knows what he/she is doing! I highly recommend the very good value set menu, with wines, though the individual courses are almost as fine. The service was great, very friendly and efficient. The restaurant was full, even on a Sunday evening so that says a lot. No negative points at all. We would definitely come back. ",5

We didn’t have room for dessert (can you believe it?). The server, Hannah, was so lovely and made sure we had a well accommodated experience. Don’t miss this place while you’re in CPH!",5
The Olive Kitchen & Bar,MACKIE901,"August 27, 2019","Fantastic Food, Fantastic Service","Dined at The Olive Kitchen and Bar on Saturday 24/8 during a recent visit to Copenhagen. It was by far the best meal of our trip and right up there with anywhere we've eaten. When you have excellent food matched by great, friendly, effortless service you have a winning combination. All staff were great but Hannah and Veronica were superb. It's a place you could easily walk past but word of mouth is so good you'll need to book in advance to get a table. Nice interior and a relaxing vibe as well. What's not to like?",5

For the main, I had the peppercorn flank steak the first time and the pork tenderloin the second. I enjoyed their French Malbec, which was dryer than the typical Argentinian Malbec. Wife had seared salmon and then duck confit on the second visit. Everything was very good. The portions are generous, especially the pork tenderloin, so leave room for dessert. On both visits we shared a panda cotta served in a raspberry coulis with a variety of fresh berries. People are very warm and friendly, and service was excellent. Happy dining. ",5

The staff are very nice and chatty, whilst being efficient and yet giving the clientele as much time as they needed between courses. We went for the 4 course tasting menu, which got better with each course. One of us had the wine pairings.The 1st course was a smoked salmon concoction nice enough but not the best quality of smoked salmon, served with Spanish cava. The 2nd course was mushroom soup with truffle oil absolutely delicious. The third course was steak with sweet potatoe purée, broccoli, served with a pepper type sauce even more delicious and the third course was a pannacotta served with a coulis, gorgeous, although one of us changed to a cheese plate served with port which was really tasty variety of cheeses",3

No a/c...but that wasn't their fault and was the only thing that wasn't perfect. Dinner started with my wife having a beer and goat cheese appetizer. I had the blue mussels in a cream sauce. Mussels come from around Mors in Jutland. I was reluctant to have them in cream sauce as I usually have them in a white wine sauce and i was afraid the cream would overpower the mussels. Boy, was I wrong..the sauce was very light and complemented the mussels perfectly. For the main courses, my wife had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. I had sliced steak with a peppercorn sauce over sweet potato puree. I had asked for medium rare which was cooked to perfection. The server was very friendly, knowledgable and it was she who convinced me to try the mussels in cream sauce. So glad i took her advice. Drinks are not inexpensive...but, welcome to Scandinavia! Located just a few blocks off the Stroget this is one restaurant that your taste buds and stomach will thank you for trying!",5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,frankwoods,"July 28, 2019",Marvellous place,"This restaurant is a must visit. The menu covers fish , meat and vegetarian dishes. We had a 2 night stay in Copenhagen before travelling around Sweden and Norway. On our first visit my wife ordered the ribs. Not a dish she would normally chose but they were stunning very well cooked and extremely tender. I started with the beetroot and goats cheese starter. The mains were teriyaki salmon with vegetables and pork loin. Both exquisite dishes. We had booked through TripAdvisor which I'd recommend as several people were turned away and this was a Tuesday night. We were so impressed that we decided that we would book a table when we returned from our road trip of Sweden and Norway. The 2nd visit was just as impressive. If you are a beer fan I'd recommend the Jacobson brown ale. Lovely nutty taste. Helpful and happy staff rounds off a great experience.Dining out in Copenhagen is not cheap but I would thoroughly recommend the Olive Kitchen and bar.",5

That is was around the corner from the Snt Petri hotel was great, but we would travel for the meal we had. The restaurant has a friendly intimacy about it, with nice, friendly service that is not overbearing or pretentious. That said, the food is the story here. Quality ingredients and presentation and attention to detail with fine flavors make for a memorable meal. What did we love. Copenhagan ribs appetizer was the bomb for a starter, as was the mushroom soup, enjoyed by several at the table. Among entrees, peppercorn flank steak was wonderful, prepared just right, and the duck was a best ever experience for our friends. My vegan wife was accomodated well with the Risotto entree. I don't think there is anything here that would not be excellent - it is the kind of place that clearly takes price in its offerings. Do go, and you won't regret it.",5

Meticulous in their approach, friendly in their demeanour, the wonderful staff waiting on you welcome you (and astound you) with their sheer knowledge of everything in the restaurant- right from where the items have been sourced, to the history of the owners and the restaurant, to what pairs well with each of the menu items. They are invested in it. One bite of your first starter/app, and so are you. It’s hard not to fall in love with this place. Hands down a meal that will be remembered for many years to come.

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,SteveP033,"June 23, 2019",All-Around Excellent,"The Olive Kitchen & Bar is a quaint spot with a cozy vibe. There were three servers, all of whom contributed equally to making our dining experience memorable. They gave great insight about the menu, including the make-up of each dish as it was being served. The food was hot, plentiful, delicious. For appetizers we did the mushroom soup, the blue mussels, and the Copenhagen ribs. My fave was the mussels; not only tasty, tender mussels, but the broth was like a savory soup. They give you a nice bread basket, which allows you to soak up the soup with the bread; delicious. The ribs were tender and savory, and quite plentiful, and the mushroom soup was very flavorable, with a bit of truffle added. For our main entrees we did the salmon, duck, and steak. The steak was cooked exactly as ordered and came out hot. Again, it was a very large quantity, which allowed us to share, and, it came with a tasty puree of sweet potatoes and a savory sauce. The duck was tender and plentiful. The salmon was excellent and, along with all the entries, a very large portion. We had the panna cotta and chocolate cake with ice cream for desserts, and they were equally pleasing. The wine, all by the glass, was of high quality and fairly inexpensive. The pacing of the meal was perfect. All of the wait staff was so friendly and helpful. It was fun to watch them work together and it made for a really enjoyable dining experience.

The restaurant only had a few other people eating dinner that early and were so nice. The service for a European restaurant was excellent, friendly staff. The food was delicious!

We both had 3 courses and every one was lovely and presented really well. We were not rushed and were able to finish our bottle of wine and relax after our meal.

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,Monk2150,"February 7, 2019",Yummy at good prices,As all the other reviews suggest this is a good food place with mid range prices. We had 2 mains and 2 glasses of wine for £50 which you’d expect same in central Lond ,5
The Olive Kitchen & Bar,Steve B,"February 5, 2019",Superb resturant,If you would like a very good quality meal at a middle of the road price in Copenhagen look no further. The food is of a very high standard with a narrow but varied menu which is why they can produce such a high standard in a small restaurant. The staff are friendly and very attentive and relaxed. Worth booking even on a Monday which says it all. ,5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,541ellenk,"January 29, 2019",Overrated!,"Came here because of the great reviews. Very disapointed. Dark and gloomy atmosphere. The ribs was pretty good for starters. Then we ordered the duck confit and wanted a red wine with that. They suggested a Pinot, but with a price of over 500 DKK for a bottle and over 200 DKK pr glass, we passed on that and had Cava instead. It would have been nice if they hade another and more reasonable option than the Pinot. The duck itself was good - hard to mess that up. The caramele potatoes boring, the red cabbage good, but the problem with the dish was the cranberry sauce since it did not go well with the red cabbage. Will not return.",2

You feel at easy, you eat at the pace you want. Relaxed. Food was quite good - the ""confit"" was just perfect. I picked it after having read about many restaurants in Copenhagen as I wanted something up to the level our weekend deserved. I agree with the absolute majority of 5 stars. Only thing I would improve: wine selection. Not more wines, that would be against the concept (a few menu items, but top notch). Just wines with more character than an american standard mid end pinot - I understand it could be an issue but that is what I personally think, with no pretension of teaching them anything as they obviously know their job very very well.",5

We tried to visit, again based on Tripadvisor ratings, but it was full booked, so we were fortunate to find a slot online for the next day. The menu is limited, which is expected for a restaurant of this kind, but well thought of. We all had the mushroom soup for starters, and then tastes differed - salmon, steak and chicken. To end the night two of the family members went for the creme brulee. If I had to rate them - I would say that the starter and the desert scored highest, with the main dishes being close but needing someting more ...

We got the ""self saucing chocolate biscuit"" which turned out to be lava cake with bourbon vanilla ice cream. It got 4 of 4 moans for goodness. Google maps had trouble finding the place. My husband said it's because the town is old that you really have to pay attention because sometimes the map is saying to go a little to the right then turn left and it's easy to miss that.

The risotto with beets was very very good as well. (Yes I ate all of these things Bc I came with my husband and 2 kids (age 9 and 12)). Oh and how could I forget the drinks!

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,262cat1980,"February 9, 2018",Birthday city break,"We visited Copenhagen as part of my birthday, and used trip advisor to help advise us where to eat. We went to Olive Kitchen on our second evening and I truly loved it. We weren't able to book a table until 9pm so after a visit to Tivoli we walked down but we're still quite early so we popped into a bar beside the restaurant. Be warned, alcohol at bars in Copenhagen isn't cheap! We ordered a Coke Zero and vodka and Coke and were 150kr, (about £18). Following this we were met with a lovely reception at Olive Kitchen, its small and cosy, and we were seated at a window seat and a couple of glasses of cava were brought to the table to celebrate my birthday, lovely wee touch. The menu is limited but what is lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. My husband had the flank steak and I had the duck, both were outstanding. My husband then chose the chocolate biscuit, it has a 15 minute wait, so we were offered some port. It was a lovely accompaniment to our meal. The desserts were worth waiting for, my husband loved his biscuit which was more of a chocolate fondant and I enjoyed the creme brûlée, although a big portion! Stunning meal made even better by the warm and genuine service and reasonable prices for Copenhagen. Very worthy of its trip advisor position! ",5

The Olive was reasonably priced for both food and drinks and we enjoyed it so much on our first visit that when we came back through Copenhagen to make our way home back to Sydney - we went again.

The flank steak with pepper sauce was equally delicious and satisfying.We unfortunately did not have room for dessert, but we plan on returning soon.

Our daughter had the crime brûlée for dessert and we had a bottle of dry white wine. £120. There are only a few choices per course but I think there is enough choice; the food was cooked and presented with detail and care. Lovely cosy atmosphere, all the waiting staff were attentive and happy to help. It's not a cheap night out for us from the UK, but pretty standard price for good food in Scandinavia. Would be suitable for couples, groups or a family. Would recommend.",5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,TrailBlazer71622,"August 4, 2017",Best 40th Birthday meal,My husband and I ate dinner here for my birthday. The food and service was simply divine. The menu selection was mouth watering - we both opted for steak with dauphinois and the meat just melted in my mouth. We followed with self-saucing chocolate pudding which again was first class. The service was friendly and attentive without being over-bearing and the atmosphere was relaxed without being casual. Quite possible the best meal we have ever had - well done! Our only regret was that we mucked up the exchange rate when we paid the bill and so only left a small tip for our lovely waitress - apologies as we had an amazing evening. ,5

They kindly split the meal for us on two plates. Deliciously sweet caramelized onions with a subtle Dijon mustard topping. We had the cheese plate for desert. Favorite cheese was the mascarpone blue cheese so creamy and not overpowering. With 2 starters, sharing an main course, and a cheese plate for desert we were full they have good portions and reasonable prices for quality food and ambience in expensive Copenhagen. They charge 10 kr per person for unlimited water (no tap) but that's ok.

The servers seated us quickly, and 4-course tasting menu was a great choice as reviewed. Food was freshly made and presented very well. Service was excellent. As we ate, more and more come and some left. I noticed most patrons were English-speaking, hence probably tourists. By 1900 it was almost full and had lost its quiet ambience I was impressed with when first sat down. Looking at the menu and reading previous reviews, it probably has not changed much over time. These suggested to me that this very good restaurant primarily serves tourists and few locals, which is not a negative but a fact. Copenhagen does have many good restaurants.

Our waitress was welcoming, funny and more than helpful. We asked for a GF menu but were told we could have almost any of the items on the menu and a GF diet would be accommodated. Brilliant! We had the salmon for our starter; we ordered one to share but they brought out 2 plates with the portion already separated which I thought was great. I was further impressed that they had given me regular bread and Richard GF bread without being asked. We both had steak for our mains; these were cooked to our preference and were possibly the second best steaks we've ever had. Most importantly, the service was just brilliant, nothing was too much trouble and our lovely waitress even gave us tips on how to spend the rest of our time in Copenhagen. If you're looking for a great restaurant, I'd highly recommend the olive kitchen; if you're looking for gluten free food without any stress or complications, this is the place for you. ",5

We then had pork tenderloin with apple mash and Panko Parmesan Chicken (breaded parmesan chicken) served with rocket and lemon capers. Our waiter/owner offered an explanation of each our dishes which was lovely. The price is very reasonable for Copenhagen - around 175 DKK for mains and 85 DKK for starters.

The food was outstanding, we were very very happy with our choices. There is such a good variety to choose from. It was also the service that made this a memorable dinner as the many other reviews have pointed out. Rebecca thank you for your excellent service! The last point is that we found the prices to be very reasonable and the portion sizes generous. Overall the olive definitely lived up to the reputation we've been reading about - highly recommended!",5
The Olive Kitchen & Bar,Passenger633872,"March 5, 2017",Outstanding food and service,"We received a warm greeting and were quickly seated even though we were over and hour early for our table. ( you can't take children into bars in Copenhagen it seems) The restaurant was full and had a lovely, cosy ambiance but with trendy olive coloured walls and wood flooring. The menu is quite limited with just 5 dishes to choose from but they all sounded so tasty that we struggled to narrow down our choice. The wild mushroom soup was the best I have ever tasted and the carpaccio was delicious too. For mains I would recommend the steak or chicken which were outstanding. Service throughout was warm, attentive, friendly and authentic: a rare combination. All deserts were great too but if I had a small critique it would be that the cheese board would have been better just with 'normal cheese' rather than blue cheese mixed with marscapone, and the port would have been better served at room temperature. Overall a very very good meal with standout service. Oh, worth mentioning that it's not cheap, over £210 for 2 adults and 2 children. ",5

We phoned ahead to see if they could cater for my needs and they were most helpful and reassuring so we went ahead and booked. On entering the restaurant we were immediately impressed with the natural ambience and the staff were really warm and welcoming. Straight away they made suggestions to my menu choice and were extremely helpful. For the first time in a very long time I felt I wasn't a problem and I had the best meal out I have probably eaten since my medical eating issues were discovered. I was even able to have a dessert...a complete rarity for me in a restaurant these days. We were also impressed that our sparkling water was constantly topped up for no extra charge. We would highly recommend this restaurant especially if you have food allergies like myself and even if you don't, like my husband, who was equally impressed with his menu choice and food.

The owner, Will, came out to talk to me specifically about my food allergies. That was a really nice touch. I also mentioned that we were in Copenhagen for my 50th birthday, and Will brought out two glasses of champagne. We started with the salmon tartar and it was served with gluten free bread. It melted it our mouths. We had the flank steak for our main course and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Portions were perfect too. Not too little, not too much.

It's a set menu and the whole table has to order it, which does mean that some of the dishes may not be your first choice and you may have to compromise. We weren't keen on one of the dishes in the menu each but the quality of assembly and cooking was very high throughout - the cheese in the stuffed mushrooms wasn't cream cheese and therefore slightly overpowered the more subtle crabmeat flavour. The flank steak was very very good, really tender. Overall there was a good mix of flavours, with plenty of subtlety and gentler flavours in some dishe ",5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,Shanna T,"November 20, 2016",Loved It!,"We had a fantastic experience dining at the Olive Kitchen & Bar, whose motto is: ""Eat more of what makes you happy"". Will, the owner, along with Alex (bartender/waitress) did a fabulous job at making us feel like locals in their establishment. Their personableness & attentiveness makes this place very special. We began w/ drinks, i ordered the passion fruit, vodka, w/ lychee liquor. I asked Alex to top it off with a dry sparkling wine, as I thought the concoction might be too sweet for me. She happily indulged me, came over to check about the taste (still a bit too sweet), & suggested a tad more lemon and sparkling wine, which made it perfect! Wow, even Will came over and commended me on the suggestion! The food was delicious, we started w/ the wild mushroom soup & beef carpaccio, followed by Olive's Orange Duck, which unfortuately left us with no room for what probably was some amazing dessert item... Great, Great, Great, Fabulous!!! It seems as if Will and his team have created a restaurant concept that is warm, friendly, and serves outstanding food! What is better than that? Thank you Will!",5

We appreciated that the kitchen split them into two portions so we could share and enjoyed all of them. The salmon was excellent with the glazed fennel accompaniment and my husband's pork tenderloin was very tender perfectly cooked with a side of mashed potatoes laced with apples. The second night we both tried the steak cooked to medium rare at our request and we thoroughly enjoyed it with the pan roasted vegetables and potato and Parmesan gratin side. The wines are fairly priced and the food prices are what you would expect from a nice restaurant in the city. But the one thing that I would add is the service was some of the best we have seen in a while.

And the service was far, far superior from the Italian staff in these restaurants) please enjoy the creative food and delightful service you will find at this restaurant. You won't be turned away 10 minutes before the official closing of the kitchen because some kind of apathetic attitude takes over the host/hostess or grumpy chef. that will not happen (until you return to italy).

The staff were all very friendly and the service was excellent. We opted for the al a carte menu, both having starters and main courses. The food was beautifully presented and perfectly cooked. We really couldn't have asked for a better anniversary dinner. Given that we had a bottle of Prosecco and a bottle of red wine we were really surprised at our bill which was about £115 including the service, absolutely superb value for money especially in the centre of the city.

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,johnsalmon111,"July 21, 2016",Best dining experience in years,"I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary as it came with a strong recommendation from a friend. The service was faultless - each person that served us was very polite and friendly, our food choices were explained at the table and we have never had a meal before that was better timed in terms of meal spacing's. We didn't feel rushed at all despite the restaurant being full and had enough time to chat and enjoy our food and at the same time we didn't question why it was taking so long. It is so rare to find a restaurant that gets that right but The Olive Kitchen definitely got this right. The food tasted amazing and was prepared so well.

Krista is partners with her fiancé and they run it with love for there customers. The food melted in my mouth. I had the salmon tartare, the risotto, and the best cocktails I have ever had. It was something with passion fruit and maybe vodka I'm not sure but Krista's fiancé would know. Due to global warming we were there on June 3rd they were experiencing very hot weather the restaurant was warm and I went outside to get air and while I was sitting there Krista came out to see if I was alright. Just like America lol. She told me that they were installing air conditioning that Tuesday coming up. Hope that went well. I will go to Copenhagen for a long weekend on my way to Italy just to go back to the best servers, wonderful French chef and fabulous owners. P.S.

We went to 4 restaurants that were highly ranked, this was ranked the highest on TA but the lowest to us. The food was a decent selection and decently priced but the food was missing some flavor. My parents both had the duck and said the veggies were better than the duck itself. I had the pumpkin risotto and enjoyed the mountain of parmesan on top of it but the risotto itself was a bit over cooked. Our appetizers, the salmon tartar and the stuffed mushrooms were underwhelming. But there were two items on the menu that they did very right!

Succulent, flavorful and fall-off-the-bone are the words that come to mind when describing this perfect start to a wonderful meal. Next I had the Olive's Signature Steak; in one word - heavenly. The beef was ultra fresh, cooked to perfection and just melted in your mouth. Served with scalloped potatoes and asparagus on the side, this dish alone was worth the trip.

The salmon was quite subtle but good and the mushroom course was very tastey. The steak for main was well cooked - nice and rare.. Whilst I thought the service was generally pleasing, they seemed a bit rushed off their feet. My other criticism was that the main was over seasoned.. Hold back on the salt if you want 5 stars from me!",4
The Olive Kitchen & Bar,dina m,"June 2, 2016",Absolutely stunning!,"When we rocked up at 8pm for a table, we were told to come back in an hour. A couple sitting down overheard us and told us it was worth it, so we decided to come back after a couple of drinks locally. We were not disappointed! We had the 4 course tasting menu for 350k each without wine pairing. Frankly each dish was even more delicious than the previous. The steak was cooked to perfection. The staff are totally relaxed and friendly and the atmosphere was lively. We tried to go back again the following night but it was full! Definitely a bargain for the quality.",5

We were certainly not disappointed. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Lena who seated us & then brought 4 complimentary glasses of Cava & wished my friend a Happy Birthday. We all opted for the 4 course set menu & the food was absolutely delicious with a different wine served with each course. Lena explained all the dishes & wine & was very friendly and attentive throughout the evening. Would highly recommend this restaurant if visiting Copenhagen - excellent food & excellent service.

The service was very attentive and pleasantly delivered with smiles and genuine caring. The Mushroom soup is outstanding, so very rich and delicious. Tip if you are also going to have the stuffed mushroom caps, enjoy them before the mushroom soup. The soup is so decadent, it may overwhelm the more delicate caps. The stuffed pork loin was delicious, a little over cooked for my taste, but I normally cook my pork tenderloin to 135 degree ",5

The cocktail list was fantastic and the whole menu was very good value. We opted for main courses only, and both were cooked perfectly and presented beautifully (duck confit and salmon fillet). Really convenient location near Norreport station, and we will definitely go back on our next visit to Copenhagen. Highly recommended.",5

It proved that my exceptional experience last month was not exceptional at all; fantastic food, delightful ambiance and warm, attentive service are clearly the norm here. I even repeated the same choices- Dry rub ribs and salmon and was equally delighted with the result. And still cannot get over the reasonable prices. Suggested to the owner that he decrease the portion size to increase his margin (they are incredibly generous.) I really want The Olive to succeed! Looking forward to my next visit here in three weeks.",5

A short while later, I walked in through the door where I was greeted by a charming young lady, who seemed a little concerned about seating me; apparently someone had reservations in a little over an hour and she didn't want any conflict. Apologetically, she told me she could seat me if I promised I'd vacate the table in 60 minutes. I assured her that if the service was prompt, I'd have no trouble doing so.

Chose the four course set menu which was very good value and had the fillet steak as the main dish - a fabulous meal, wonderful flavours, and of just the correct portion size accompanied by a great Argentinian red Malbec.

Both my husband and I had the Olive 4 course set menu with wine, and each course was superb. The steak was, dare I say it, even nicer than the very good steak we'd had the night before at KOD! Lovely atmosphere and they even made a bit of fuss of my husband who was celebrating his 40th - the birthday flag will now be a tradition in our house!",5

It is located near the university and is very easy to find. We showed up about ten minutes until they closed. We actually thought they were closed because the door sticks a little. Make sure you push harder on the door or you might think it's locked. Don't make that mistake because you will miss out on probably the best food in Copenhagen. My friend and I got mushroom soup, dry ribs, steak and the chocolate brownie. Everything was mouthwatering. No lie! It was absolutely delicious food. Besides the amazing food, the owner and staff were so personable and hospitable. They made you feel very welcome and made sure everything was to your liking. Thank you Krista.

I had looked on here for places to eat as I wanted something special for my mum. The Olive Kitchen & Bar could not have been more perfect for my needs. On a wet, cold Copenhagen evening, as we stepped inside we received a warm welcome and were shown to our table straight away (it's advisable to book, but I got a table for the following day when I called). We had a full three course meal, wine and after dinner drinks for £44 a head! The wine selection was small but perfectly formed, as was the menu - there are only a few dishes, but they are done very well. The flavours and presentation are superb, and the dish is 'presented' to you, so you know exactly what you are eating. The only downside is you have to pay for the water. It's filtered, but this is the only place I have been in Scandinavia that charge for the 'tap' water. Still, don't let that put you off coming - it works out about £1 a head!",5

My friend's fish and my risotto were both delicious. While there wasn't a salad on the menu, the restaurant accommodated my longing for vegetation with a composed salad of greens and asparagus, beautifully prepared.

We all ordered steak and were not disappointed - beware - rare steak is almost raw, so if you like it cooked a little bit more, go for medium. The staff were very friendly and helpful and there was a great atmosphere. Food was excellent. Only slight critique is that it was very noisy; there was one business man at a table further down the restaurant who was so loud we could hear every word he was saying!

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,NeilChicago,"April 21, 2016","Fantastic Find, Astounding Value","We walked by The Olive Kitchen on our way to the Skt. Petri Hotel just around the corner (great place to stay by the way). Had heard it was one of the hottest new restaurants in Copenhagen. Luckily we were able to get an early table. The 48 seats in two rooms give a sense of intimacy without crowding. The simple decor creates a wonderful ambiance. But the highlight is clearly the food. The Dry Ribs were the best I have had (beating out the ribs at Black Hog Barbecue in Frederick Maryland). Juicy, flavorful and fall off the bone. Not to mention that for 85 DKK (about 13 USD) there were 6 on the plate. For mains my colleagues had the Pumpkin Risotto and the Crispy Duck and their smiles told me all I needed to know. My own salmon was prepared simply and perfectly with just enough seasoning to bring out the full flavor of the fish. And even though they have a very small menu, when we asked for something vegan for our fourth colleague, the kitchen was more than cooperative. In fact, the owner came by and said he called his mother in Vancouver to get a vegan salad dressing recipe. For any price the portions were generous. For the actual price of 175 DKK (or about 27 USD) they were amazing. And for Copenhagen, they were unbelievable. This is a very expensive city so when we walked out of there with two courses plus a round of drinks and coffee for 4 for under 1200 DKK (no tipping) I was astounded. And on top of everything the service was beyond impeccable. Everyone who worked the table (owner, manager and waitress) was genuinely warm and engaging. This was one of the most enjoyable meals I have had in a long time. It has become my must-go restaurant in Copenhagen.",5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,gordonHighWycombe,"April 19, 2016",Wonderful experience,Was looking for somewhere in Copenhagen to eat before an evening flight back and chose here because of the reviews it had received recently.The whole experience was a sheer pleasure from the fantastic seasonal food to the amazingly good service provided by the staff.I cannot praise too highly the owners who greet you once inside and make you feel as if you are long lost friends and the meal itself was such good value for money in a rather pricey city.I will certainly revisit here next time I am in the city.,5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,thomaslU5011GV,"April 17, 2016","Fantastic place, delicious food, excellent wine, great service","The title says it all .-) We were a party of five celebrating my son's 22nd B-day with a 3-course dinner, including for starters: beef carpaccio (sprinkled with 2-year old, aged Parmesan), salmon tartar (delicious, makes you want more), and dry ribs (a whole pile, nicely stacked, and not dry). For the main course, I picked the salmon, while the rest of the party had the signature steak (which, fortunately, was more than the 9-year old could eat, so I had a taste of that too ;) Desserts included creme brulee, mixed fruit sorbet, and the best: the self saucing chocolate biscuit! Our friendly waitress choice of accompanying wine was also excellent; a Brazin Old Vine Zinfandel, Lodi 2013, very aromatic and intense. A great experience - and affordable too.",5

The Olive Kitchen & Bar,Capri_lover2010,"April 11, 2016",Simply wonderful. A truly great restaurant!,"I was in Copenhagen for a short weekend on my own and, being new to the City and travelling solo, I wasn't sure where to eat on the Saturday night. I turned to trusty old TripAdvisor and this restaurant was rated number 1. Well, all I can say is that it met and exceeded every expectation of a restaurant ranked so highly. From the moment I phoned to make the reservation to the moment I walked in and found myself being shown to a table, I knew this was going to be a very nice experience indeed. And so it turned out to be. One always feels a little self conscious eating in public in a nice restaurant alone. At least, I always do. And yet, I was so well looked after and the waiting staff were so charming that all my anxieties of eating alone melted away. I actually really enjoyed myself. One member of the waiting staff in particular was utterly delightful. In fact, she was charm personified. That accolade goes to Lena. Thank you Lena for making me feel so special. You very thoughtfully gave me something to read while I was waiting for my starter. What a nice touch. That showed real class. A restaurant that puts themselves in the shoes of their customers and asks ""what can we do to make this a truly memorable experience?"" Wonderful! The food was delicious - cooked to perfection. The mushroom soup starter was the best I have ever tasted, anywhere. And the Norwegian salmon fillet just melted in the mouth. So well prepared. Unfortunately, time did not permit me to have a desert and I'm not sure I would have had room for one anyway but that just gives me a very fine excuse to return here the next time I am in Copenhagen, which I most certainly will. Just go - you won't regret it!",5

Ark,JakobAaquistJohansen,"September 4, 2020",So much more to wish for,"Finally it was friday and I met my beautiful wife at a new plant based venue in town. The restaurant is sitting in a mezzanine with a great view of the busy life of central copenhagen. Excellent for watching people of all sort passing by. Stories unfold as you sit in a spacious and thought through environment. The waiters are courteous and take their profession seriously. We sat at a table just next to the window with a great view of the street. First we had a glass of a lovely cava, just right without the sometimes honeylike sweetish aftertaste of cava. We decided on the 5 course tasting menu, starting with a creamy avocado with peas and radishes - dip and babaganoush with sweet semidried tomatoes. It was served with semolina crackers. To be honest that was 2 types of dip, guacamole (so creamy it was without any structure) and babaganoush that was very salty and ash like in the taste. Then came gnocchi with mushrooms, again not at all interesting, bur fat and with very little imagination. The only highlight of the dinner was the grilled cauliflower with crunchy topping. It is a standard in the plant based kitchen and only stood out because the rest of the courses was so disappointing!! Desert and wine was all splendid. The overall impression of the waiters, the venue, the geographical place and the atmosphere is great, BUT and this is essential! If your are looking for interesting, tasty, fine dining plant based cooking you should look elsewher ",2

I’m a newbie when it comes to vegan food and I was a little apprehensive about traveling on that much of a restricted diet, but this restaurant made it both easy and delicious! The burgers are incredible and sweet potato chips are definitely a must. Overall - can’t recommend enough (if you’re willing to spend a little more for a high quality meal that’s good for you and the planet). Staff was amazing too, super friendly and with impeccable english. (I didn’t take a picture of the burger because it looked DELICIOUS and I was hungry so I forgot)",5
Ark,BobbyPumpkin,"January 2, 2020",Amazing vegan food and service - An absolute GEM in Copenhagen!,"We chose Souls for our New Years Eve dinner. From the moment we booked our table, staff made sure we were going to have a good expérience. I asked if they could make a gluten free option and they responded immediately, assuring me it was possible. The moment we arrived, staff greeted us warmly and the place had a cozy vibe with candles and great music. The service was top class! The prosecco was delicious. I dont even usually like chardonnay but the one they paired with our salad was perfect. The food itself was creative, wholesome, visually appealing and sooo flavourful. My only complaint is that I wanted more! Each course was carefully prepared and the staff explained all the ingredients when serving. Our glasses were always replenished with water. The staff checked with us regularly to ensure we were satisfied. We have alreadt recommended it to several friends and cant wait to go back to try their regualr menu. Even as we left, staff opened the door for us and we felt VIP! Very personal touches and top quality food = an excellent experience. Thanks for making our night so special!",5

I cannot think of one negative thing to say about our experience. The food was delicious (we both had the fake beef, bacon and cheese burger) and agreed that the menu was really thoughtful. If you are vegan/vegetarian because you don’t like the taste of meat there is a bean burger that you can substitute any of the beyond meat burgers for. Our waitress Maria was so welcoming and friendly. She offered lots of tips for things to do/see in the local area too. Even the loos were nice!! The only thing that could be seen as a slight negative is that it wasn’t traditionally Danish food. But what would you expect when you come to a burger place?",5

The sandwich itself is huge, and kept me going for the full day. It could easily be shared between two people for lunch. It cost approx. €12 which is not bad for Copenhagen. There are only 6 seats in the venue itself, so order to go and find a nice spot to sit and enjoy - bring plenty of napkins! Expect a 10-15 minute wait as all are freshly made up.",5
Smagsloeget (Vesterbro),Ron C,"June 25, 2018",Best sandwich outside US!,"Best sandwiches I’ve had outside the USA since I left in 1994! Traveled and lived all over Europe and Asia and this place is the best! Thought I would tell them how to make it, but after reading the menu, I just went with the suggested combos. Tuna and Italian (#3 and #10) were heavenly! Cheap by European standards and even more so by Danish! If you’re staying at the SKT Petri, even though this is a fancy hotel, it is worth a visit! Student spot, but very interesting sandwich menu with Iberico ham and various Italian delicacies. The brown bread is spectacular too! This place will take off. Too good for the price!",5

And great!,"We tried this place out after reading an internet tip on our recent trip to Copenhagen and we were definitely not disappointed. We were warned that the sandwiches are massive but I mean, really they are MASSIVE. You could easily share one between two (unless you are starving), but then why would you when they are so damn tasty? By English standards at about 79DKK I suppose that's quite an expensive sandwich, but in Copenhagen this is cheap, and when you take their huge size into account this is as bargainous and delicious a lunch as you could hope to find in the city. As it's right near Rosenborg Castle it is also very handy when you are touristing, although it's clearly a popular spot with the locals too which I think is always a good sign. I wholeheartedly recommend!",5

We ordered Tuna salad with all the trimmings plus a Serrano ham and mozzarella extravaganza. The sandwiches are freshly made so were told we'd have to wait 10 mins. Well it was definitely worth the wait.. we adjourned to a gorgeous vantage point next to the river and devoured two of the most delicious sandwiches we've ever tasted. Each one was big enough for two people of average appetite so you could save some money and buy one to share.... we were just greedy. In summary the perfect picnic food in a wonderful city.,5

The Shrimp,jewberry0103,"August 17, 2019",Disappointing ,"The place had a lovely outdoor seating and the weather was perfect for dinner as it was also just a few meters away from our hotel. Our drinks were served at once, however it took 40 minutes before the waiter came to apologize that it’s taking longer than expected and that our starters will take 15 minutes longer. I asked for a high chair for my 2 year old son and it never came. The lobster bisque and calamari were then served around 65 minutes after we first sat down... no bread we’re served in the meantime and the bisque turned out to be extremely over-seasoned. The calamari was drenched in coating and the very very thin slice of octopus inside was almost invisible. The ribeye and tenderloin still took 30 minutes to be served after our first dishes were cleared out. The meat and the side dishes it came with were “ok” at best. Worst service we got in Copenhagen...and for our last dining experience before heading out to the airport in culinary capital in Scandinavia, this restaurant was very very disappointing. ",2

The waitperson, Ola was very attentive and pleasant. She felt bad about the smaller size of my dish, and said she told the chef to prepare another one for me. The first one was probably 5-6 ozs. so I really didn't need it, but certainly didn't turn it down. Both pieces were easily cut with a regular dinner fork.

The Midwestern Diner,Lars R,"February 6, 2020",I’ve been to Midwestern Diner,"I’ve been to Midwestern Diner thrice. They get an A for effort in decorating the facilities, but the result is more tacky and artificial than the average diner experience stateside. Also, the staff’s antics get old quickly: we are routinely told to eat the burgers with our hands like Americans. This would be amusing only if I did not know what a burger was, and after three times it gets annoying. They make really good burgers and fun desserts, and I always appreciate the culinary experience. It’s probably the best burger I’ve had in Copenhagen, but many places are fairly close in terms of quality. That said, they deserve four stars for the burgers (including veggie burger) and shakes.",4

Zahida,AnjaMichelle,"April 6, 2021",Try it! It is worth a visit,My sister has talked about Zahidas Mamas house burger so many times. I am a big fan of burger and fries and yesterday I finally tested the famous burger. It was really good. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The fries was crispy and seasoned with masala spices which I have never tasted before but it was really good. It won’t be the last time that I have the Mamas house burger or the last time I eat at Zahida. The food is good and the staff is so friendly and helpful. You should try it!,5
Zahida,Ellinora_norgaard,"April 5, 2021",Always the right choice ,"I see myself as a foodie, never compromising on quality - then rather not eat. But when it comes to Zahida, and basically everything there is on their menue, I ask myself this question; Have I ever been disappointed? The answer to that question is easy, NO. I haven’t. Today was no exception. My craving was satisfied. If you haven’t tried the Mamas house burger, you are missing out. The chicken is so tender, pared with a tasty house dressing and a light bun. The frites are crispy seasoned with masala spices - it just doesn’t come better than this. Not only to talk about the food, but the hospitality and warm hearted people behind Zahida is worth the visit. Friend that became family! Thank you guys ! ",5

On this last Wednesday of Oct, it was Butter Me Up-Wednesday, and we got a serving of Butter Chicken for 89,-. along with our Zahida G&T which had a grapefruit twist to the classic recipe, a great recommendation by Bobby.

I think back on the burgers one tasted in Pakistan and especially those with especially different spices. They were really delicious and it's definitely something you come back to. in last we just got mango gulfee and panna cotta with coconut flavor.

It was written that two cheesecakes were in the menu, but the waiter didn’t bring them, so we asked and he answered that he bring them to people if we ask because many people are already full at this stage. We then thought that the desserts were included in the menu, so everyone took one. When the bill arrived we were schocked, it was written that one menu for two wasn’t 350 DKK, but 350 DKK PER PERSON and they didn’t include the cheesecake.

The service was quick initially, and the starters were ok, but our mains weren't good. We ordered the kebab burger which was dry and covered in mint sauce (with beef?). We had high hopes for the butter chicken after lots of reviews mentioning it but it tasted like a shop bought jar. The portion size was huge (wish we shared and saved some money!). The naan bread was just normal bread (like a pitta rather than it being 'bubbly' like a normal naan) smothered in garlic butter. Being from the UK we are spoilt for choice with decent Indian food so that may be why, but it might also just be that it was rubbish. ",2

For desert we had the mango cheese chake. This was very good. The service was good and the staff was friendly and nice. But after the main dish it took a long time before they cleaned away the dishes on the table and not before we asked for the dessert. I would have understood this if it was busy but it was not.

As a Brit living in Copenhagen for the past 15 years the thing I have missed the most is some decent spicy food - until now! This wonderful Pakisani restaurant, with a menu based on 'Mums' recipes is phenomenal. Not only do they stand out head and shoulders above any other Pakistani or Indian restaurant in Denmark but they beat hands down almost every restaurant in this genre that I ever visited in the UK. Now I don't just have decent spicy food, but rather exceptional, well balanced, tasty, beautifully cooked spicy food! We like a bit of punch so Bobby kindly spiced up our butter chicken from the Chefs Menu a bit - still the taste was perfectly balanced and it wasn't spiced to the point you couldn't taste anything. And there was a perfect end to the meal with a wonderful cheesecake. We can't wait to return.",5

I did follow my nose to the back of Westmarket, sat on a stool and was warmly received by charming raconteur Bobby. As I arrived 45 minutes before closing, many more vegetarian meals had sold out. I enjoyed Manzo premium Pilsner beer (cold) x 2, Zahida’s chicken curry, basmati rice, garlic naan. Bobby had some daal left and put fresh chilies and cilantro- the best I have ever eaten! All excellent!!! I ordered a mango lassi to have for breakfast. Thank you Zahida for teaching your sons how to cook! Highly recommended!!!",5

Full of potatoes and the crust is yummy. Worth the trip down if you're in copenhagen. Was skeptical when arriving at Westmarket Food Court. But once we've started eating, its the best decision ever.

Zahida is squashed in the middle of a mall and you eat at the counter. Not a place for sit down service and definitely not mid-range. Should be put in low end eats.

The naan was tough and hardened in spots. The service was rude and patronizing. Arrogance was unappetizing and so was the food.

They have taken family tradition and built a wonderful business. We had seen the restaurant our first night in Copenhagen when we went to Mamemi, and decided we needed to come back. Our return was on Sunday night, but did not realize the early closing hours - so made a point to return on Monday. Are we glad we did. We were warmly greeted by Bobby and were able to wrangle the last 2 bar stools at the counter. Bobby deftly described the menu - ""everything is good - we only make 6 things""! He recommended we have the mixed grill - 1 chicken and 1 lamb, a bowl of the curry, rice, and some naan. Follow his lead - and say yes to the Cilantro (unless you have a taste aversion). Needless to say the food was delicious! My wife fell in love with the lamb chop, and I thought the chicken was spiced perfectly. We had the house IPA along with our meal, and enjoyed our evening of banter with Bobby. Looking forward to your expansion to the States - look us up when you decide on Seattle and Portland!",5

Take the charming cook/cashier/entertainer's advice and order the mixed grill (tandoori chicken and lamb chop) plus the chicken curry with rice or garlic naan. Wash it down with the IPA beer.

Zahida,legkiy,"July 5, 2017",Sublime taste but limited menu,"Most people come here to check out no.1 rated restaurant in CPH. Just bear in mind it is essentially a small kitchen in a larger food court, you order at the bar and eat at a communal table (self-service). The food tastes excellent, I had a curry - just about the right level of spiciness, full of flavour. But due to a very busy day they ran out of rice, daal and lassi, so the dinner menu was basically a choice of 'meat and bread' (curry or grill, burger, and naan). The owner is extremely friendly. I hope they keep up the good job and thanks to tripadvisor success will be able to open a proper restaurant in the future, where I would come back with pleasure.",4
Zahida,syzygy66,"July 5, 2017",Excellent Pakistani food in Vesterbro foodhall,"Perfect for a quick but delicious supper, Zahida has wonderful curry and other Pakistani specialties, served at the counter in this Vesterbro foodhall (or you can order takeout).

Zahida,Karen H,"July 4, 2017",Definitely worth the trip,"We always check out trip advisor for a good curry before going abroad. Zahida definitely deserves it's #1 spot. It was quiet as we were there early so one of the owners was able to talk to us about the kind of curry we like and make something to suit. We had chicken from the grill, chicken curry and naan. It was simply delicious and worth the long walk to find it. Relaxed atmosphere and a welcoming host. It is in Westmarket which you would easily walk straight past if you didn't know it was there. It looks like an office foyer from outside but is filled with foodstalls inside. We got to learn a bit about the start of Zahida, a very recently opened restaurant owned by two mancunian brothers, surprised by their quick rise to #1 status, following their mum's traditional pakistani recipes. You won't be surprised when you go. We also got to hear about places to visit in copenhagen all while eating flavoursome, stomach-pleasing food. Definitely worth visiting though they will surely be somewhere bigger very soon. If they are still at Westmarket make sure you turn on googlemaps, you don't want to miss it!",5
Zahida,Nabeel11,"July 4, 2017",Amazing authentic food!,"Visited Zahida for lunch. The food was amazing, genuinely authentic Pakistani food and extremely tasty.

Zahida,Subhan M,"July 4, 2017",Food and service are sublime,"As always, I had expectations high when I went to Zahida. The Affridi brothers greeted me with the best manners and started serving the food. Keep in mind I NEVER have had Lamp chops before - But the brothers ensured me that I was gonna love it. I was convinced and had the Lamp and Chicken Grill they serve, and my God, it was amazing! Delicious meat without fat, had an amazing taste, juicy.. I mean everything you could imagine. For those who are considering visiting Zahida, do yourself a favour and visit it. The Affridi brothers will definitely take good care of you.",5
Zahida,nancyanngeorgeb,"July 3, 2017",Mama must be SO proud! ,"My first trip abroad, to meet up with my college kid who'd been backpacking Europe alone for over a month. We were determined to taste all the, ""best of"" that Denmark had to offer. Went to TA as usual, to scope out the best of the best. To say, Zahida earns it's number one spot, would be an understatement. My son and I biked to Zahida's to make it on a Sunday, for an early dinner knowing it would be closing at 5:00. Having arrived just before 4pm, we were so disappointed when the kind man behind the counter, (who turned out to be one of the two owners) told us they'd run out of food due to the onslaught of diners throughout the day. We had no shame about practically begging him for anything he might have left to serve us, just so we could brag to our friends back home about experiencing this culinary delight. He served us up two bowls of the most delicious lentil soup we'd ever tasted! The soup and the naan bread were very satiating and seasoned so beautifully. The owner even took time out to sit with us and tell us all about their history, and how determined they both were to make their mom proud by learning to prepare traditional Pakistani food for others to enjoy. Although we were leaving Copenhagen the next day and as such, couldn't revisit to enjoy all their specialty dishes, what a treat to have experienced a real, ""taste"" of what they're offering their guests. Love this place, for the incredible food and unique experience. ",5

Based on the 100% positive reviews we decided to go therefor our Saturday dinner. Because of all the great reviews, we thought it would be important to make a reservation - we called and left a message. After a little difficulty finding the restaurant (it's located inside a mall), we were immediately greeted by one of two brothers that opened the restaurant just four months earlier. He asked about hour level of hunger, our food tastes, and spice-level preferences then recommended a mixed-grill dinner for us. Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Chops, Curry and Naan. OMG - we were blown away by the wonderful taste of each of the dishes as well as the personal attention we received. I had intended to try Momma's (chicken) burger (based on the reviews), but went with the suggested menu that night. My friend and I made a special point to return to Zahida the next day for lunch so that we could try their burger before we left Copenhagen later that day. We met the the other brother and learned more about their background (first-time running a restaurant, all family recipes). Again - WOW!!! Check this place when you're in Copenhagen",5

The curry and tandoori chicken are amazing -- chicken served atop spinach drizzled with a mild chili citrus dressing. Unforgettable. Co-owner, Bobby, is a warm and humorous host.

We had the Zahidas's Curry along with rice and a plain naan. The chicken was tender, the sauce was extremely tasty and the service was definitely with a smile. I only wish we had discovered this (and the WestMarket hall) earlier in our stay. Don't be worried about heat - they will cook it to taste, adding more or less chilli as you wish.",5

Zahida,somsubhroc2015,"June 4, 2017",A gem if you are ready to look for it,"Read so many excellent reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try while I was in Copenhagen for my 2nd visit of the city. I really had to search for it as it's one of the many vendors in the West market complex is Vesterbrogade, all lined up in a food street style. But if you do manage to get to them, you are bound to be delighted by even the limited number of dishes it serves and more so by the warm and friendly host Boby who would even suggest dishes based on out appetite you bring. Let me be straight, Zahida's chicken is the most awesome dish I had there. Such an authentically spiced and tender chicken peices at the same time is not something I expected somewhere in Europe. Go for the day's curry as well. There was a chicken curry with green peppers in onion sauce(Being an eager cook myself I somehow felt traces of brinjal to bring that sweetness although Bobby denied ). Touching authenticity it's prepared keeping in mind European taste buds as well. Then they have lamb chops which was almost perfect (a bit too salty to my liking). The naan could have been better too. The mango lassi had a homemade flavor. Overall just go for this place. You will not repent your choice. The ever smiling host will add to your otherwise brilliant gastronomical treat.",5

The signature chicken curry is to die for, it is so deep in flavour and the spices are open and warmed up under the perfect amount of heat. Juicy chicken, tasty spices and just.... Try it! And the house burger from Zahida... Hands on my heart - Best burger I've ever had, and it is a chicken-burger?! Nevertheless, it is great. Not just the chicken ut every paert of the burger, from bun to breading. An absolute winner! (Go double if you love food, and are hungry as hell). This is a great example of authenticity combined with passion, love and lots of knowledge of tastes and flavours - and food of course. The two brothers who own the place, work their behinds off, to serve something that is equally delicious every time. They've found the key to consistency - and they love what they do, which comes through in the flavorful food. Spectacular place, and so recomendable for anyone currently in Copenhagen; who likes amazing food and great company in terms of the two funny, polite, attentive and great as hell brothers standing behind the counter.

We went earlier in the evening without a reservation.The staff was seemed surprised but nonetheless excellent and attentive. It, at first, seemed like there was just too many wait staff there but later on we could see the necessity to provide proper service.The menu is kind of this weird notebook, like something a kid would put together if they were playing restaurant(who would play that anyway). The menu is somewhat limited but we selected two different pizzas. The offerings were indeed different and later explained by our server, Roman Style. Ingredients such as speck, goat cheese, eggplant (we had to explain to the fellow countryman, a young American, and his friend that Aubergine was Eggplant as they were confused) and potatoes were some of the varied ingredients. The ""pizza"" came out hot and both were larger than we expected. One probably would have sufficed. Neither had tomato sauce on it. Of course, we had wine and the wines were hand selected by the owner and certainly not mainstream. I had read the owner was a transplant from Italy (as did the wait staff appear to be) and a bit of a wine connoisseur. The Chianti and the bold red, which variety I cannot remember, were excellent and had healthy size pours. Very delicious and filling the tastes melded well and were satisfying. Prices were more than reasonable (especially for expensive Copenhagen). As we ate, the restaurant became increasingly more crowded and busy. Quite the popular place. The décor is nothing out of the ordinary but the restaurant was comfortable and relaxing.",4

Pizzeria Mamemi & Wine Bar,648holly,"May 1, 2019",Not good for vegetarians,"It's lovely inside and very cosy, but we were very disappointed with our meal. I'm a vegetarian so my only option was the marinara pizza (80dkk), upon ordering the waiter asked if i wanted it with mozzarella as it doesn't come with cheese at all, which cost an extra 30dkk (making the pizza approx £12 in total). When it arrived, it was a pizza base, tomato sauce (which had NO flavour to it) and sprinkles of mozzarella which hadn't been cooked onto the pizza. It was the most flavourless, boring pizza I have ever eaten, and I cannot get over the price that they're charging for what is essentially a margherita. It's even pricier than pizzas with pancetta and pork cheek on. My boyfriend got the pizza with the pork cheek and apple, thinking it would have small slithers on apple on. It came out covered in large slices of an entire apple, with bits of pork underneath so it overpowered the whole thing.",2

The starters and desserts are quite classical in their presentation, whereas the pizzas are a bit on the experimental side. All around the craftsmanship is spot on - texture and taste is balanced perfectly. I highly recommend 3 courses, so you start off with the classical (the burrata is brilliant), the “new” pizza (try the pork cheek and apple) and end on a classical dessert. The staff is knowledgeable and extremely professional. I recommend that you let them pair the wine with your courses. If you are going as a group, then I’d recommend to let the staff find you a bottle or two. The extended wine selection is among the best in Copenhagen.

The menu is small with approximately 3 starters, 4 pizza options and 3 desserts. However, if you love pizza this is the place to go. We ordered a bruschetta each and a pizza each. They made a mix up with the tables and our pizzas arrived quickly afterwards before our starters. But the staff were very apologetic and quickly rectified this and we had the pizza and was quite full so just shared a bruschetta afterwards.

Glad we did as the pizza size is not ""large"" from a US perspective, and one pizza was enough for 2 adults. One pizza was with mozzarella, eggplant and capers which was a hit for us. The second was with a spicy salami, peppers and olives. This one, I liked but it was spicier than even I expected and my kids wouldn't finish theirs. Not a problem as I finished off theirs ;o).

Daniel helped me choose a wine and let me taste it before pouring the glass. The pizza consisted of a very thin crust topped with delicious, fresh ingredients. It was more than enough food for two hungry travelers. Even better than the food, which was outstanding, was the hospitality. We sat at the bar the first time and chatted with them while they prepared our food. We truly felt welcomed like family. We thoroughly enjoyed our second visit (we ate the same thing all over again, it was that good the first time) and enjoyed the outside patio area. It was a fantastic way to begin and end our vacation. The cost was less than $50 US, which is a bargain for Copenhagen and this level of food. Exquisito! :)",5

According to tripadvisor, this was the best yet the most budget friendly pizza restaurant in the neighbourhood, so we were more than willing to give it a go. When we arrived, we were shown to our table by the waiter, due to the small menu (which I always consider a good sign) we made up our mind rather quickly. The people who ordered maybe 2 minutes before us, received their pizzas in the next 10 minutes, unfortunately we were forced to wait 50 minutes (!!!) for ours. Maybe the order got mixed up somewhere along the way, but honestly, I think the waiter just forgot about us, although we were sitting right next to the door - well that was a bummer but we waited and waited hoping to get a taste of the best pizza in town. Once our food arrived, almost an hour late.. we were slightly underwhelmed, my pizza was quite cold and my partner's pizza the ingredients were uneven, half of the pizza had cheese, the other half just the vegetables.

He is a passionate chef from Rome and has been in Copenhagen for 10 years to make real Italian pizzas. I could hardly describe in words how good the pizza is. Go try it for yourself!! I’m going to tell all my friends in Hong Kong to come (after 4pm!!).,5
Pizzeria Mamemi & Wine Bar,JulianPCork,"July 9, 2018",Simply amazing,"Ignoring the dilapidated ruin of WestMarket that MaMeMi Pizzeria is situated in, this is simply an amazing pizzeria. The menu consists of only six pizzas chosen by the owners which are far from conventional but are justified by how brilliant they are. We loved the potato and Pancetta pizza, but in reality we'd recommend them all - we felt obligated to go back and visit a second time during our time in Denmark. Expect thin, crispy bases, a nice seating area both inside and out, and friendly Italian owners who are extremely talkative and love feedback. Simply sublime and a must visit in Copenhagen.",5

You’d think it would make ordering easier but I still had to eenie-meanie-minie-mo to decide which to order. I settled on a pizza with pork cheek and apple. Can’t say I’ve ever had those toppings on a pizza before but I was not disappointed. The crust is thin and the toppings are just right. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the guys make your pizza. Service was quick, efficient, and friendly. The price seemed a little high for my American sensibilities but not outrageous for the quality of food. ",4

Soelleroed Kro,Ccs133,"November 1, 2017",a pleasurable whole experience,"This is my second visit to this restaurant but with a different chef. The restaurant is a bit of a trek from central Copenhagen but well worth the journey. The last time we had a tasting menu that was so extensive that we had to surrender with much regret as the food was wonderful. This time, we had the tasting menu and that worked well as the tasting menu was delicious (with many dishes duly covered with winter truffles). We received however, many amuse-bouche and they were tasty and interesting. My particular favourite was this little greenish apple roll with verbena which had such a nice clean flavour and which was one of many wonderful preludes to a great meal. What I particularly liked of the actual tasting menu was the ""in-house caviar"" (sollerod caviar en surprise) which actually masked sliced razor clams and a savoury panna cotta. This was followed by another dish also with caviar (oscietra/squid and mussel) but what I liked was the contrast of the two styles of caviar. This was followed by a wonderful dish of celeriac covered scallops and lemon. We did have an extra course of cheese and truffles, an indulgence that was well worth it. The turbot was good as was the beef and the listed menu dessert of Jerusalem Artichoke, hazelnuts and malt was delicious (and thankfully not heavy). At the dessert stage too, we were given many items not listed on the tasting menu which were wonderful. I loved my orange canele and the gold coloured chocolate bar. I also liked the little surprises in the additional desserts such as pomelo. Sollerod is a lovely warm setting for a great meal with a wonderful host in Jan Restorff and great food. Good ambience, pretty surroundings, great food, efficient, knowledgable, warm service- what more could you ask for? This is a restaurant well worth the visit",5

It is situated well outside Copenhagen in idyllic settings which makes for a nice excursion. Søllerød caters to the classic french cuisine and as a Michelin restaurant predates the nordic food revolution started by the guys from Noma et al. In my opinion the new(ish) chef is successfully transitioning the restaurant in a modern direction without losing touch with the roots. They might even deserve the second star for taste - sometimes. Great service. As with most danish gourmet restaurants quality doesn't come cheap though. With that in mind: Best wine card in Denmark and Jan Restorff is really up there with the best sommeliers.,5

You are offered champagne as an extra welcome item, but since you get this for your first dish, it’s really too much, you’re really getting enough to drink during all the dishes. The menu is definitely one star Michelin level with a mix of “signatures” of Søllerød inspired by the French cuisine. The restaurant is located in an area of very wealthy Danes and I guess the restaurant charges what it can: I’ve never paid so much for food and wine menus in Denmark and I’ve tried the 2 star establishments too.

Soelleroed Kro,468henrikt,"July 2, 2015",Surperb food in charming surroundings,"Have been to this place on several occasions and has never been disappointed. The food is of very high quality, mixing classic French tradition with modern Danish cooking. try either a fixed menu or select some of their signature dishes. The Michelin Star is more than well deserved. The wine selection is huge and delightful, particularly Bourgogne, but if there is one small criticism from my side then it is that they do not offer a wine menu for the fixed menus, you have to buy per bottle (or from a smaller selection by the glass). Service is superb, well timed, attentive and top professional. The location is absolutely charming, an old inn from late 1600 which a nice gentle modern touch.

She is a vegetarian and the kitchen adapted its inspiration menu to ensure that the eating experience was a special for her as everyone else. Impeccable service, the food was local, delicate, modern (but not too experimental, so all the family - from grand-kids to grandparents were thrilled).

If you like caviar then dont miss their Caviar ""en surprise""! They probably also have the most impressive winelist in the country and have won several awads for best wine list in Denmark.

It might be a small thing but the still water that we ordered was also at a crazy price. After one sip we got a refill and with our glasses still full there was a new and opened bottle on the table without asking if we wanted a new one. We drank only a little from this bottle and obviously it was on the bill. The wine prices are also extremely high compared to the same wine in other restaurants.

This can be a very expensive restaurant, but there is a more reasonably priced menu, which I decided to stick to. I very much enjoyed the tasty little touches and amuse bouche between courses and the courses themselves were delicious and very well presented. I have been to many restaurants of this stature where the flavours in the food can be more unusual and intense which provides an additional level of surprise and enjoyment, but in this case the flavours were a little tame and on the safe side, which was slighlty disappointing.

It is clearly expensive but again well worth it. We would go again without question.,5

Soelleroed Kro,Palmeroa,"March 2, 2010","yes, worth a visit!","Well, the interior is a bit old fashion and certainly not ""danish design"". But the cook is good, no doubts. And the reinterpretation of nordic food in a modern key is not bad either. We had a set menu, leaning on the fish side, and must say they are good at that. You woudln't expect less, for the price they charge, but hey, if what you get is good, it's no crime to charge a lot of money! Only one dish based on meat was not, according to my partner, worth the effort. And the wine list is ""jabdropping"" - just check the list of champagnes available!",4

The food is very good- the drinks too- though not so sure about the quality of the vodka? Only issue as such is that it goes too fast- so you eat and drink a lot in a relatively short amount of time. It is fun- I would definitely go back but book the later sitting hoping that it will not go so fast but that you can get the time to enjoy the food a little bit more!,4

Relaxed atmosphere, good background music, friendly staff, and, most importantly, great food. A wide range of dishes meant there were loads of options for the vegetarians and non-vegetarians in our party of 4. Very impressive and friendly customer service..had tried to ring in the morning to book a table but got the answer phone. Although we hadn't left a message they rang us back 2 minutes later and let us know that although they didn't accept bookings we should be OK...and luckily they were right. During lunch we managed a quick chat with the friendly chef/owner Søren (Det var hyggeligt☺). The only problem was that with so many tempting dishes it was hard to choose. Will definitely recommend this to our family in Amager and hope to try some of the other dishes next time we're visiting. ",5

I have a severe allergy to seafood and the owner took the time to explain how the food is prepared so that I know if anything came in contact with my allergens.

I was actually disappointed as I booked this place to celebrate something but it ended up this way. The courses came too fast and the menu was too little. I was not full at all and had to have another meal afterwards. There was not anything that I remember from the dinner except the bread.",2

I cannot speak anymore highly of this restaurant. Great time thank you.",5

My meal was incredible with peak fresh ingredients. The portions were perfectly balanced and the presentation was instantgramable (if that is a word). The service was impeccable with clear explanations of what we were served, great suggestions for wine/beer and the waitperson noticed a bug had landed in my wine which she quickly replaced with a new full glass. She also recommended a route back to our hotel that completed a perfect evening.",5

To eat we choose the seafood-based serving menu with vine pairing. Though the food was good, we were a bit underwhelmed as it wasn't amazing. Also several if the vines were quite similar. Over all a pleasant experience until we were rick-rolled at the end of the night. Would definitely consider giving it another try as the atmosphere was very pleasant.",4

We chose Pescatarian. The menu looked interesting and the various reviews were good. The choice was a true winner! We had a fantastic six course meal with every course outstanding. Each person had a slightly different set of favorites, ranging from the first course of scallops to the dessert of wonderful mixed berries! Between we had lobster bisque, halibut, squid, and cod. For example-the perfectly cooked cod was surrounded by baby Swiss chard and covered with oyster buerre blanc. We had finely shaved fresh truffles over the cod- a wonderful addition! We enjoyed every one of the paired wines. Service was perfect. I was a little concerned initially at how quickly the first three courses arrived, and then the pace changed. We were there for 3 1/2 hours and loved every minute. We were seated in the entry area near the bar- a perfect location for our group of 8 because it was relatively private and quiet.

The restaurant called us couple hours before to confirm reservation & ask for any food allergies. That was unexpected but I think it might be handy for somebody. Service is very friendly and professional - you'll get all info you need. As far as food is concerned - we went for 6 course menu and it was perfect. Taste and size-wise. The biggest highlight for us was the squid & the green sauce that goes with it. We did not try the wine paring - but some cocktails - I suggest the one champagne-based.

There is simply no way of describing the food other than to say it was superlative in every way. Usually, vegetarian dishes are boring after-thoughts or ridiculously earnest but every one of my dishes was complex, interesting, and coupled with an appropriate wine (different from the wines accompanying my companions' pescatarian options).

We arrived a bit early due to a needing to get inside to avoid a crazy storm. Since our table was not yet ready, they sat us at the bar and gave us a complimentary glass of champagne. We were then seated at the group tables looking into the kitchen. We had the full menu with matching wine. We also started with a few oysters. This was one of the best meals I have had ever. It was far better than several Michelin star restaurants that I have been to. Our favourite dish was the squid pasta. The combinations, textures and presentation of each dish was phenomenal. The service was outstanding as well. They were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. If I knew that they were going to be so generous with the wine we would have only ordered one wine pairing as I was unable to finish many glasses of my wine. At one point we also asked them if we could have an extra 10-15 mins before the next course to enjoy the wine and they were happy to do this. This is definitely a place not to miss.

During the meal, we were serviced by a number of people, which may have lead to a few lapses and pauses during the otherwise great menu. The food was spotless however, tasteful and well presented. To me, a few of the fish portions were almost to little fish to help me appreciate the kitchens abilities.

Truly elevated fish cuisine, with lovely staff (Johann) and sommelier who knows his stuff. In fact, the challenge with delicate food such as fish, is to pair a proper wine that is there but does not take over, and that when the buttery or acidic sauces come in play, and this is what is accomplished here, the wine is in the background, supporting the food, which is a danish modern approach to fish, innovative and at Star level. The staff accommodated us after wandering around, with our little 9 month old, that even scored the private tour of the kitchen.

The Pescatarian,Sarah G,"June 5, 2019",Great tasting menu!,We had the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairings and ordered 1 extra course in between the main and dessert. That was a good amount of food as we also indulged on the delicious bread. We enjoyed everything. Very creative and tasty. They have incredible restaurants in Copenhagen and I would include this restaurant in that description. A great dining experience!,5
The Pescatarian,455karinj,"June 2, 2019","No, it's not worth it!","We went here Friday night with high expectations. We decided to go with the grand menu and share a wine pairing package, and so far so good. The only thing was that we several times had to ask our waitress to speak English, it seemed like she forgot it every time she got to our table(we do understand Danish, but not that well). The first two dishes came out well and tasted delicious, although they were very small in size. Then it took 45 minutes to get the third dish, but the paired wine came out 40 minutes earlier e.g it was lukewarm when the dish arrived. When we had waited for another 25 minutes for the fourth course to arrive, we asked the staff if this was as expected, which it wasn't. Apparently they had have an ""extremely busy evening"", but as a compensation they offered us some extra truffle on the main dish as well as free coffee afterwards...! After a smaller debate they agreed to give us some economical compensation as well as an excuse and some new, cold wine. The main dish came out 20 minutes after the fourth one and was hilariously small in size! Maybe 50 g of fish at the most... So, even though the food tasted really good all the way, it wasn't at all worth the money or time spent. A restaurant with such high ambitions and high prices needs to improve a lot to be worth spending. Sorry. ",3
The Pescatarian,Jbjim12,"May 30, 2019",Exceptional price value ratio!,"My husband and I appreciate visiting gourmet restaurants across the world, quite a few Michelin Star awarded ones are amongst the ones we guest.

The Pescatarian,wilhelmm-norway,"May 23, 2019",Great tastes - but hardly a meal,"The Pescatarian promises the best the seas can offer prepared by the best man can provide. In its purest sense the restaurant delivers: Great tastes and delicately presented courses. However, something is wrong when you have to arrive un-hungry to the restaurant to truly treasure their delicacies. Each course represents the amount of a regular Amuse-bouche. Thus, by the time you already have consumed your main course, you feel ready to start the meal. Good thing they serve plenty of delicious home-baked rye bread! Throw in sustained slow and unattentive service (with some notable exceptions!). We left, impressed with the tastes we had been offered, but with a sense of having been exposed to a version of The Emperor's New Clothes, only 100 meters away from the Queen's castle in the fairy-tale country of H.C.Andersen.",3
The Pescatarian,tdevos83,"May 23, 2019",Exceptional with one slight issue,"Firstly, everything about this place is just exceptional and deserves 5* but from my personal experience I was tempted to drop a mark but just couldn't do it. The issue was that it was my wife's birthday and I booked here after reading the reviews and the fact that compared to the other 'high end' restaurants in Copenhagen, if offered very good value for money. The issue was that I had requested to sit at the chefs table, overlooking the kitchen but when we arrived the member of staff said that as it was a special occasion they had moved us. So I was thinking maybe a private room or a special table somewhere. Nope, it was a standard table in the main dining room, with one seat on the end of a long bench and the wall started to taper in, so my wife essentially had a triangle of bench to sit on and a sloped wall to lean back on. Not a great start and in hindsight I should probably of said something but it was very busy so didn't really want to make a sce ",5

We loved the enthusiasm from all the staff, from explaining the dishes to suggesting wine options (within our budget). Pescatarian gets really busy even mid week. Definitely book in advance ",5
The Pescatarian,RoteFuchs,"May 20, 2019",Outstanding Nordic seafood in international top class,"Pescatarian is nothing short of amazing. The interior is perhaps not as fancy as in other gourmet restaurants and the staff are more down to earth, but the food is on an international level that is awarded with Michelin stars. Pescatarian serves a vegetarian as well as a seafood based menu. The courses are relatively small and made of the best fresh ingredients, beautifully arranged. One course follows the other and at the end of the meal you sit back with a big smile on your face having had one of these rare experiences where something is truly exceptional.",5
The Pescatarian,Richard C,"May 17, 2019",Awesome,"This newly opened restaurant is absolutely fantastic. The staff are incredibly enthusiastic, knowledgeable, attentive and total ambassadors for the food and ambience at The Pescatarian. My wife and I went for the short flights in Fish and Vegetarian with attendant flight wines. We were not disappointed. The dishes that we each received together with the incredible commentary on the dish and the wine made for a truly memorable evening. The blending of flavours, attention to detail led to us saying that this is one of the best meals ever. We each had 4 courses ranging over cod, monkfish, beetroot berries, fermented milk, sea buckthorn to mention just a few. Each dish a treasure. This team deserve more than a 5 star on Trip Advisor.",5

Located not far from Little Mermaid statue, Pescatarian offers a very friendly atmosphere with open kitchen. The food was stunning as described by many reviews. They had two main menu which is suitable for many preferences. We had our son with us, and they even tailor-made a dish for him. The staff are very well-trained and always with some sense of humor. We started off with the natural oyster which was so good that we ordered extra one. Then followed with 4 course menu with wine pairing.

We were led through the courses and the wines expertly and learned a ton about ingredients and preparation techniques, while enjoying every single one of the seemingly hundred different flavors and combinations. The monkfish was spectacular, perhaps the best cooked and prepared piece of fish I have ever tasted. Get the full pescatarian menu with the wine pairings, sit back, and put yourself in their hands. You will have a very special evening as they lead you through the nordic dining experience.

Our table tried both the vegetarian & pescatarian menus, which I would highly recommend, as there are dishes from each that I loved. The food is beautifully plated (Instagram-worthy), and tastes just as good. My favorite course was a tie between the modernized lobster bisque and the beet/smoked goat cheese foam, which were in the same course just before the main on each menu.

Many inventive cooks forget that. You will never forget some of the signature dishes, but you will probably also always remember the settting in which it was served, which is a big part of the experience and and big part of what you are paying for.

Out of the 50 servings we couldn't point to one that didn't work although we had plenty of favourites. Visually, I loved the Velvet Underground banana serving and the lamb brain (no i hadn't had that before but its delish). I have never tried anything that combines innovation, beauty, perfect produce, amazing technique and most importantly taste in such an incredible setting.

Yo are served between 30 and 70 small tasting courses- each incredibly theatrical, beautiful and most of all delicious- from an ever changing menu (mine will be different to yours depending on when you go). Very modern, molecular gastronomy, and amazing unusual wine pairings. To detail the courses would ruin the surprise but be prepared to be wowed. Because of the small nature of the restaurant ans the way the dishes are served, the service is excellent and the head chef and others also serve and you are able to ask questions about the food. Fits more into the ""experience"" category, as opposed to being overly romantic, but something to share with a friend or partner who really enjoys food. A one in a million experience courtesy of a chef that is sure to go far. I dont imagine it will be easy to get a table in the future so a real privilege to enjoy such a fantastic meal.

I have had food at many places, but the food and novelty in the combinations is out of this world. The service is really nice and takes time to talk to you. If you are there in the potato season, you HAVE to try the potato dish with onions and chiffon. Also, the champagne is really worth a try. The high amount of pinot meunier makes this a very different champagne from your average.",5

It is not until you notice the long line of Michelin’s awards on the door that you start to realise that here you are on to something spectacular and the moment you enter through the door and are greeted by the staff your adventure begins. Marv & Ben is a contemporary, relaxed casual restaurant with food, wine and service on a very very high level that can easily stand out in a comparison with much more formal and more expensive gourmet restaurants. The whole meal and the many delicious courses runs smoothly and you soon realise that you are in the super capable hands of staff that does not only love their job but are also extremely good at what they are doing.

There are suggestions of caviar as a snack start, for me the good recommended white riesling and freshly baked bread with whipped butter was perfect. The freshly baked bread tasted amazing. I chose a full menu and didn't regret it. However, the first dish came relatively quickly. The six dishes was both beautiful and tasty, small complex Scandinavian-style taste surprises.

The space feels a bit lackluster and lacking in atmosphere. There was a 'private' event in the adjoining room so they closed the curtain between the two spaces which felt somewhat awkward as we could hear their speeches during dinner and to get out to the restroom we had to open the curtain and go through the space where the large group was seated. Service was average, but left a bit of a bitter taste as the waitress tried to upsell us at every possible opportunity. I really wanted to like this place but sadly it fell short.

Marv & Ben,Samoht60,"July 15, 2019",Excellent experience!,"Dinner for two at Marv & Ben. Totally unexpected we had an amazing dinner with truly excellent food and beverages. The set menu we had chosen was mostly seafood but also featured a very delicate piece of local lamb which was outstanding - the only issue was the fact that I did not get a few more slices of the lamb! From the amuse bouche to the bread, the starters and main courses - each dish was prepared with great care for outstanding presentation coupled with the freshest ingredients and matching ingredients. Prices were acceptable and with a few glasses of champagne, a bottle of wine and a set menu with four courses and three extra starters, we paid less than in many lower rated restaurants in Copenhagen. Service was extremely friendly by a group of young servers who were very knowledgeable of their product. Overall, an extremely memorable evening and a restaurant that is very strongly recommended.",4

Do book in advance.",5
Marv & Ben,Hobbitton,"July 12, 2019",Outstanding food - even better service,"We dined last night, four people at Marv & Ben. The food was exquisite, outstanding and very delicately prepared - but what really topped of the evening was the service. Personal, friendly - and the good time the staff clearly had serving us, that mood they passed on to us and others. Marv & Ben is a hidden gem in the Copenhagen nightlife.

The sourdough rye bread was good and I ate it so quickly that my server brought more to the table. Each course was small but presented wonderfully, described meticulously and tasted delectable. My only mistake was not licking the plate when finished.",5

It was great that they allowed us to choose different options. The portions are quite small but we left comfortably full, not unpleasantly stuffed. The staff were absolutely delightful- very warm and welcoming, informative and helpful. It was a more expensive meal that we are used to in the UK but not compared with other fine dining options in Copenhagen and was worth every penny/Krona.",5
Marv & Ben,kelangst,"June 9, 2019","Fresh, local, and unpretentious","Very much enjoyed a night at Marv & Ben. The service was spot on from start to finish. The food was a tour of locally fresh ingredients and while presented with flair was unpretentious. The ambiance was intimate in a small room within a larger building. But all of the space felt inviting. Food was of course impressive in its diversity of flavor and had a few key ingredients that made multiple appearances to tie the meal together. Highly recommended,",5

Traveling alone is not always the most pleasant experience, but being put at a table for ""one"" seems to make it worse - almost as though one was being excluded which is, in fact, how I felt. In addition, the restaurant was totally inflexible in terms of offering wine, a glass of water, and almost everything else. Every request was either a negation or, at the very least, seemed to be an imposition to them. As for the food, it was chewy and barely edible. Not sure what the hype is about eating here...",2

Marv & Ben,Amanda V,"May 19, 2019",Fantastic Dinner & Service,"Recently I went to Marv & Ben for my birthday with some friends. Even before setting foot in the restaurant, the experience was off to a great start--Gustavo called me to confirm some details of my reservation, and was warm and friendly on the phone. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the host and the server (Chris) who would be working with us that evening. From start to finish, the whole evening was fantastic--the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable. We had a couple of people in the part with dietary restrictions, which were accommodated without issue. The food was absolutely delicious: we opted for some snacks to start and the 4 course menu, which was great as we were full when we left, but not too much so. Also the bread is not to be missed--it is absolutely fantastic. Gustavo also helped us with wine recommendations, and suggested one that was popular with the whole table. We were sitting in the back room, & it made the whole experience much more ""hygge"". I would highly recommend Marv & Ben for a special occasion, party, or just a nice night out. ( plan to return soon myself to try the other two courses I missed!",5
Marv & Ben,peugeot307,"May 10, 2019",Great restaurant!,"I was staying in Copenhagen just for one evening, so spent some time choosing the restaurant and booked a table couple days in advance. This was the best combination of reasonable price and high rating - and I was happy with my choice, it is actually an amazing value. Had a 6 course dinner without wine pairing, just couple glasses of wine. All dishes were cooked super-nicely, and I liked in particular the sauces that were coming with them, they take the taste to a different level. Would give to all the courses served, especially liked trout for a started and the main of a lamb cooked for 10-12 hours at 52 degrees. just excellent dinner and doesn’t make you feel super full, so it’s a good balance of quantity, not easy to achieve. Highly recommend.",5
Marv & Ben,madhulikag2016,"May 9, 2019","Great experience overall , disappointed with main course as a vegetarian","Loved the service , ambience , attention to details. As a vegetarian, I had mentioned while booking on TheFork app that I don't eat egg, meat and fish . We called on day of reservation to make sure of the reservation and they said they were very ready to attend to me which my food specifications. We decided to go with the 4 course option with no wine pairing as I only drink sparkling wine . Loved the first 2 course - first course was zucchini swirls in a amazing cucumber sauce and second course was artichoke -crunchy and out of this world . The main course was disappointing in terms of quantity-was 2 stalks of brocolini and some kale. I don't think 2 stalks of brocolini was a good satisfying substitute for lamb which was the non vegetarian option.the dessert was all right. The experience was overall good . With 2 glasses of wine each with 4 course it came to around 215 usd .",4

I took the 6 course tasting (it seems there are 4 and 6 course options) with wine pairing. The food was creative, local and presented in interesting ways but it was also delicious. Wines were thoughtfully paired and generously poured and each dish and glass of wine were described in detail. It was one of my best dining experiences in a long time.

Copenhagen isn’t the best for gluten free so I was absolutely delighted when Marv & Ben confirmed they could do every dish on the menu gluten free (with only very small adjustments) and they had freshly made gluten free bread! The bread and every single dish was fantastic. Taster menu dishes can be hit and miss but every dish was very good and not too rich so you don’t leave feeling like you’ve overindulged but you won’t go hungry either. I can’t recommend this place enough. Surely heading for a Michelin star. The wine we had was delicious, the sommelier got it spot on. The staff were all lovely, can’t do enough for you.

Marv & Ben,ASMcM,"April 5, 2019",Probably the Most Fun you’ll have in a Restaurant - Anywhere!,"A warm hug awaits you at Marv & Ben. As we stepped down into the restaurant from the street, we were greeted by big smiles, and a rapturous welcome from Alex, as though we were long lost friends. Alex became our host for the evening and wow!what a show we put on for us! This was dining theatre. If Cirque du Soleil ran a restaurant Alex would be the ringmaster! I cannot rate this restaurant, Alex and his while team highly enough. As a special birthday celebration for our son, we chose the full six-course tasting menu with complementary wine pairings. The precursor ‘snacks’ were delicate adventures in flavour notably the very special bread smoked with bone marrow and served with a light, whipped white buttermilk. Indeed, so sublime was this bread we even took one home with us. Each dish - beautiful, minimalist, unpretentious and complex - warranted perfectly chosen wines to which we were treated generously. From ‘liquid silk’ whites to smooth, full flavoured, robust reds, each glass was a delight. But to complement delicious delights you need great people and we were looking for an wonderful experience not just great food and drink. This is where M&B excels. Walk into this restaurant and prepare to be entertained. We certainly were. In M&B we have found a new friend and we very much look forward to a return visit.

Marv & Ben,sjam2014,"April 2, 2019",Tasty Tasting Menu! ,Great little gem in one of the oldest streets of Copenhagen. Would highly recommend the “4 favourites” tasting menu as well as going for the “snacks” (amuse bouche) with a cocktail.

Marv & Ben,kie72,"March 25, 2019",One of my favourite restaurants in the world,"Went to this restaurant last night on our quick visit in Copenhagen and we are blown away by the food and friendly service. No long queue or difficult process of booking... everything was prompt, friendly and very attentive (which could be another story if you dine in London's top restaurants for example). The food - as expected - were superb. The homemade bread stole the show and we had two bowls of them. We ordered Four Favourites Tasting Menu and each of them was special. Perhaps less blown away with the dessert (caramelized apple) but very pleased with the grilled pork and the Jerusalem Artichoke with the crispy filling. I'm not sure if this place has already got a Michelin star but is definitely worth at least one! If I have to give a little criticism... that would be the somewhat depressing interior. Perhaps it's just the typical Scandinavian 'clean-lined' style that didn't sit well with me personally... but I'd appreciate more comfortable seating and beautiful props. Just a thought.",5
Marv & Ben,JamesCMcC,"March 25, 2019",Very Clever Cooking,We had the snacks to start and snacks they were.

The quality of the food, presentation, and service were better than many other places I’ve tried who do have stars. They had 4 and 6 course options for meals, wine pairings, and options for cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks. Really nice staff in a cozy atmosphere (the restaurant was converted from an apartment). Online booking was super easy from their website. Some folks were dressed up, others more casual in jeans and sweaters, so ties/jackets definitely not required. Highly recommend for a delicious meal.

The service is amazing and we had some fun chats with Alex the co owner. We had the “four favourites” menu, all of which was amazing. However the absolute standout dish was the Jerusalem artichoke, which was paired perfectly. True one bite jaw dropping awesomeness! The Sourdough bread was also an absolute knockout (yes i am reviewing bread, it was that good). And all amazing value for money.

To be honest a little disappointed with the food. Felt that the waiter came and explained the many ingredients that went into the dish but we felt that there was always one dominant flavour. Presentation was excellent and while there was nothing wrong with the food it was not a place we would be raving about or going back  ,4
Marv & Ben,samtL1572WE,"December 23, 2018",Wow,The staff was so kind from the minute we stepped in the door. They were fun and very attentive. My husband and I ordered the 6 course tasting menu which was incredible! I’m someone who is fairly health conscious and felt like this place just gets it. They blend flavors perfectly and use a lot of fermented foods. Fermented food promotes healthy gut bacteria and overall health! Their bred was also a big hit. It’s sourdough bread made with bone marrow!! It was so tasty and also suitable for people with a gluten intolerance. Not only were the food & cocktails amazing but they really understand health and flavors in a way that most restaurants don’t. This meal and experience was worth every penny! Thanks for a good night out with my husband!,5

While it is perhaps a bit unfair to compare a Bib Gourmand with a 1 Star, I feel they should be subjected to similar criteria. The ambiance at Marv and Ben was elegant and the wait-staff were attentive (without seeming to hurry) and knowledgeable about the culinary gifts they bestowed. Several of the dishes on the Four Course menu were very memorable: the succulent nature of the Chicken confit contrasted well with the pickled rhubarb & fermented garlic; the depth of flavour and texture of the bread was sublime; the special 2-cheese course dish with a strange after-taste of the seashore (very weird!). Despite these, in my personal opinion, the individual flavours were not as distinctive as I had hoped they would be in some of the dishes, unfortunately. Minor point: No decaf coffee was available which was somewhat unexpected. The experience overall, however, was a very pleasant and memorable one.",4

We chose a 4 course tasting menu with wine pairing as we had already eaten quite a bit throughout the day. I expected the small portions so wasn’t disappointed on that score. The wines selected were good too. The bread was delicious in fact that was the best bit for me. The flavours were intriguing but not exceptional. I thought it was expensive for the amount of food we consumed. So all in all good but not great. ,4
Marv & Ben,kristenmY9795QP,"November 11, 2018",Overrated and Bugs,"I realize the reviews are glowing. But heed my warning - my husband and I went there for what we expected to be a glorious dinner while on vacation in Copenhagen. We expected the price tag and that is not the issue. Each course was more underwhelming than the next. Seasoning was nonexistent, the best “course” was the bread, which came have way through the meal (they “forgot” to bring it). The bland food was one thing, but the major issue were bugs. Fruit flies - upwards of 20 swirling around the small room where we were eating. First off - it was disgusting. Secondly, not what one expects when you are paying for a food experience at that level. The waiter even acknowledged the flies and made a joke. The only highlight was the wine pairing and do to our wine consumption, at some point in the evening we stopped trying to kill the fruit flies. All told - it was possibility the worst dinner experience I have had at a fine dining restaurant. ",2

We picked the 4 course menu and they were kind enough to make it completely vegetarian for us. Although 4 courses may appear to be too little, in actual fact, it filled us up completely and we were not left hungry at all as we walked out of the restaurant a few hours after we had walked in! The best parts of the experience were (i) attention to detail - every subtle flavour had a place on our palate and did not get overpowered by other stronger tastes; (ii) the extremely helpful and knowledgeable waiting and kitchen staff who took the trouble to explain to us what each course was comprised of and how it was made; (iii) the wine selection. A lot of attention is paid to enhancing just the right flavours in just the right dishes that are put together in just the right way that makes you connect the tastes with memories of other things you may have had earlier but presented and created in entirely new ways. A lot of emphasis is paid on sourcing the ingredients locally and are fresh for the season. Wonderful experience! Thank you Marc & Ben. ",5

The presentations were a treat for the eye (How did I forget to bring my phone for photos?) The taste combinations were amazing. Simple food (such as creamy potato) were paired with crispy cheese accents and a lovely variety of herbs. Even this dish was delightful. The lamb with sorrel, strawberries and several herbs was prepared perfectly and so tender one did not need a knife!

The execution was perfect and the flavors were interesting and delicious. And, even though it’s not cheap, I felt that it was great value (we had the full menu).

All 6 courses were an incredible mix of flavours, textures and inventiveness, though loyal to the best of Danish cuisine. The accompanying bread has also to be mentioned as it was probably among the best we have tasted. The portion sizes were perfectly judged (though appear small - deceptive) and we were certainly well satisfied at the end of the meal.

One of us is a Coeliac and that was absolutely no problem and when the GF bread was served it was amazing. We chose the 400 kroner meal and our own wine selection and service in this area was attentive but not pushy. The water was also never neglected. The meal was four courses of incredible flavours - clean, fresh, modern Scandi! We did not leave hungry. Another lovely touch was the crockery but the silver ware was just stunning.

The best meal of our trip to Copenhagen (we had dinner in 3 different Michelin rated restaurants), such creative and complex dishes, layers upon layers of flavours that work. Amazing that I can book a restaurant like this on the same morning using my iphone, and end up getting a private room for 8 with superb service. We had the 6 course tasting menu, plus a cheese course as well before dessert. We ordered a few beers to try and share, and they poured it into smaller glasses for each person at the table to try, what service! They even asked us what pace we'd like our dishes to be served at, which is the first time any multi-course serving restaurant ever asked us that. The bone marrow brushed bread was amazing, crispy crust and warm chewy centre. Our kids were starving for more and they offered to bring out extra loaves for us and they didn't even charge us for it! My favorite was the yakitori grilled lamb rump with grilled romaine lettuce brushed with fried spinach puree and dehyrated kale over green strawberries and fermented gooseberries. Such a simple looking dish, but so complex in flavours. Anyone who says the meat was too small or the lettuce was too simple in this dish, clearly didn't listen to what ingredients were used and didn't appreciate the amount of labour needed to create such a fantastic tasting dish. Beware they do use charcoal smoke liberally in some of their dishes (which I'm a huge fan of).",5

We ordered one 4 course and one 6 course meal, along with a bottle of wine. I always look over the complaints if I'm selecting restaurants with the help of TripAdvisor, and I will offer a couple of thoughts in response to the few people who have been critical. We found the staff to be very friendly and committed to creating an excellent experience. It surprised me that anyone had a complaint about service, but I suppose the risks of a problem are always higher for larger groups. My general reaction to Copenhagen was that the Danes are very friendly, relaxed, and welcoming to their tourists. We also found the pricing to be very fair (compared with the US, and especially considering that tipping is not required - and is never as big a cost as in the US). When I'm worried about pricing in a restaurant like this, the first thing I do is order an inexpensive bottle of wine and avoid the wine pairing (I trust restaurants like this one to offer only enjoyable wines). I hope many of you will try this place.",5

The food is a great example of new Nordic cuisine and was both surprising and tasty. There are no gold dipped ants here, just good food and really friendly servers.

However, the portions are TINY, and even thinking about ordering off of the a la carte' menu is a joke. The quantity of food was misrepresented by the waiter. On wine, we believed that we had ordered a bottle of wine to share, but they charged us by the glass, and then when we asked for glasses, brought an entire bottle.

We enjoyed the tasting wines and loved it that they were generous with their wine portions, (my biggest gripe with tasting wines). Our only disappointment as such was that we assumed Marv and Ben were people, maybe a couple or maybe Brothers and we would have loved to meet them afterwards to congratulate them. It turns out however, that Marv and Ben equates to Marrow and Bone in Danish, apparently we weren’t the first to get this wrong. They put the Marv and Ben to excellent use in the Bread and Butter, possibly the best bread and butter in the world. Highly recommended ",5

The staff is definitely welcoming and efficient which is definitely a plus. Yet, I felt the food was very uneven. Some dishes were fab (the bread is actually to die for), yet others were trying a bit too hard to impress like the hazelnut chocolate desert that was far to sweet and which I could not finish. The spot is definitely worth a visit but I d say: guys don t try that hard and everything s going to be all right. ",3

They managed to find a table for us, though I would advise you book in advance. We just got lucky! We went for the set menu of 4 courses. The portions are tiny but I did feel full by the end of the meal. My friend was still a bit hungry. While I enjoyed all the dishes, I was only wowed by the dessert, which is why I give this restaurant a 4 instead of a 5. ",4
Marv & Ben,Ihvash,"August 21, 2018",Absolutely Fabulous!,"Perhaps the kindest reception after we walked in late without a reservation, the team advised on the incredibly creative menu choices as well as wine list. Each dish is beautifully constructed, with interesting flavors accompanying classic products, like halibut, sole and lamb. The sourdough bread at the start and accompanying butter is simply to die for. Each member of the team is kind, humorous, explaining the make-up of the food and engaging on all kinds of other topics. A perfect introduction to our visit in Copenhagen.",5
Marv & Ben,Ade W,"August 20, 2018",Up there with the best... anywhere,"This is a very very good restaurant. I've eaten at a lot of great places in London, Paris and Rome but in terms of service, taste and sheer inventiveness, Marv & Ben ranks right up there. From the booking to the table, everything was super smooth and attentive without straying into fawning. The same was true of the service at table, neatly divided between five or six of the staff so that each course had someone different describing its flavours. We went for the four course set menu (we wished we'd gone for six just to experience more of the flavours) and opted for the wine selection which was superb. The fact that we are pescatarian was accommodated with open arms and there was no hint of compromise. We also went for the 3 x teasers to start... maybe a tad expensive but if you want big plates of food, try elsewhere... for sheer culinary inventiveness, come here. I won't describe every course but the potato dish (which sounds like it could be exceptionally dull) was just phenomenal in its depth and textures. The dessert was the best I've eaten anywhere - no exceptions. I will return to Copenhagen for many reasons but to eat at Marv & Ben again will be one of the foremost. Congratulations, guys, just wonderful!",5

For the a la carte orders, grilled lamb and lemon sole, the portion size was minuscule ...... more of a light appetizer than a full course meal. The volume of food was not commensurate with the high price. Although a direct comparison can not be made, it also appears that wine prices were on the high side. Total bill for 4 persons: 2000 DKK.

She never mentioned the cost (which is quite expensive per older reviews). We refused, and the food came out right away. Her wine knowledge was not very impressive.

Marv & Ben,SnorkelWales,"May 11, 2018","Friendly, knowledgable, enthusiastic team, excellent food.","From the moment we arrived everyone was extremely welcoming and seemed genuinely friendly. The restaurant was full so booking would be advisable. We decided to have the four favourites menu and were offered and accepted an addition of a glass of champagne and 3 small appetisers. The appetisers were nice, especially the cod roe but remember if you are coming from the UK everything in Copenhagen is relatively expensive and this added 400 dkk to the final bill. On the main menu we paired the four favourites with the wine flight. Every pairing worked very well. The portion sizes were an initial concern in that they seemed quite small but we both left feeling full but not ready to burst. The asparagus starter was light and fresh, it tasted like how freshly cut grass smells. Their sour dough is something else. The best bread I have ever eaten. The next course was a potato, mackerel and smoked cheese dish. We would go back just to eat that. The third course of lamb and asparagus was extremely good. The jus gave the lamb an almost game like taste. The fermented rubharb with yougurt dessert finished the meal off extremely well and the final “wine” pairing was a very well matched surprise. Great food, great team who really seem to enjoy their jobs. The next time we are in Copenhagen we will be back.",5

Maybe is it because you made foreigners pay for water and not locals? It happens also in France, please avoid this. Second, especially on fish dishes be more generous with the fish, some courses where vegetable with fish ""as a side dish"". This two things would have gave you 5 instead of 4. ",4

And for £300 we expected a lot more than just ‘nice’. None of the courses are that memorable and it was only a couple of weeks ago but I can barely remember any of them. I was also disappointed that they knew it was for my birthday but we didn’t get anything special, not even a mention of a happy birthday.

Marv & Ben,Steinar V,"December 18, 2017",Thoroughly sympathetic,"I's not very often that I, as an amateur, get to eat twice at the same restaurant - within a week... This happened to me this year - by ""accident"", so to speak, as I had booked a table myself for an evening with my crew - and then received an invitation from someone else to dine at Marv & Ben a week before the dinner I'd planned. Anyway, it really helps in terms of assessing an establishment to visit twice. The first time, we were nine people and had a chambre semi-separé. The second time around, we were six and were seated in the main restauant. The service was noticeably more professional on the first evening than on the second, and it just felt like a different class restaurant. Not that it was awful or anything on my second visit, but our table just seemed to have to fight for attention, while we got it automatically on the first visit. As for the.food, we had the set six courses both evenings; the first time around with accompanying wine menu and the second time around ordring wines from the list. The food is creative and esthetically presented. However, as the price is quite moderate, it is also quite conspicuous that the produce to a great extent is basic and cheap. And yet, it tastes - on an overall note - between good and fantastic, and sometimes quite interestingly. Some dishes sound more fantastic when prsented than what they taste like - such as the potato dish with gherkins and lovage, which by the way was much more delicate on the first occasion than on the second. The tartar is not the best in town, however a little different. The absolutely best dish of them all was the first one - the cod with glass cabbage and a mussel foam. Sublime. A little sad, though, that none of the remaining five dishes reaches he same level... The wine list is limited, but with some very good wines at decent pric ",4

We started with champagne and some starters. We were pleasantly surprised by the adversity of both taste and presentation. We ordered a 4 course meal with the wine package. Clever choice. Fish, oysters, pig and a very very good desert with garlic (!). All of the plates were served with carefully selected wines. Wine and food combinations we would never had considered tasting proved to be pleasantly completing surprises. You can really see and feel that the staff really have put their knowledge and will of giving a complete experience to their guests.We truly believe the Michelin star is on it´s way. Thank you for this wonderful night which has expanded our taste buds. We will for sure come again.",5

They serve everything that is local, and organic they won't even use salt or lemon because it was not from their country, but have amazing and I do mean amazing substitutes. Now I am a huge Caviar fan so I ordered their Caviar dish which melts in your mouth. The space is small which i love and very comfortable. The staff was amazing and explained everything about the food and where it came from. Everything from the appetizers to desert was amazing. Lastly it was very affordable considering the food and service we received. If you are visiting this is a must go to and is walking distance from the center of town. Make sure to make a reservation.",5

The food is wonderful, classic Italian (including the best risotto in town), the staff is friendly and attentive. The owner's love for wine is evident in the restaurant's name, and their wine list is extraordinary. Best of all, their wines are not limited to Italian wines (although they have the aplenty of high-quality through price ranges), they are well-stocked in high-quality Californian, and - particularly - Bourgogn ",5

Enomania,wilhelmm-norway,"September 21, 2019",Outstanding - and reasonably priced - what a combo!,"First there is the restaurant: Rather down to earth and un-snobbish on a street corner in Frederiksberg - but what an atmosphere! The owner and staff transform these unpretencious locales into a true Italian atmosphere and experience - and what magic they provide! From the menu they provide, you do not have much of a choice: It is a set 4 course menu, and it is wonderful. To match it, Enomania provides an exquisite wine menu. Usually, I look to select and compose our own wines, but here my advice is clear: Enomania know what they do, you cannot surpass their wine menu selection unless you end up with significantly more expensive wines then they have selected to go with your meal. Our experience was that the quality of wines developed throughout the entire evening, while the meal and courses in themselves maintained a very high and even wuality throughout the evening. Unlike several other high-rated restaurants, your smile will not disappear when you get the bill at the end of the evening. This is definitely exceptional value for money! If you are in centre of Copenhagen, do not hesitate to take this short taxi tour to Enomania at Frederiksberg - it is certainly worth a visit; and then you will want to visit it again! we will be back!",5

The list is quite short and it changes regularly. The possible choices were 3: risotto, pasta and meat. We went for risotto (with cucumber, pumpkin seeds and halibut rolled in bacon) and pasta (lasagnetti with mushrooms and arrabiata sauce). The risotto was incredibly tasty!

For someone (like me) who can barely taste the difference between red and white then the passionate gentleman still explained all about the wine menu with true dedication. Service was top nudge!

Enomania,JanochBarbro,"March 18, 2015","A small, Italian gem, well worth its Bib Gourmand","This is our third visit, now with a group of friends. This is not a five star luxury style of restaurant, or fancy ""fine dining"" but a small and crowded truly Italian place, with home made pasta, risotto, secondo and dessert. Menu changes so you don't know in advance what will be on offer. But it's like family home cooking, with a twist. And the quality of cooking and service is very, very good indeed. On top of the food experience, the wine list is absolutely fantastic. Great choices from Burgundy and Piemonte, and at great prices.",5

Enomania,Jo65_DK,"September 20, 2014",Authentic Italian,"This place is ruined by Damiano Aliberti (an Italian) and his wife. Therefore you can immediately feel like you were in Italy. Great atmosphere and warm service. You feel like at home. Damiano's passion for quality wines is reflected in the bottles and wine menu. The food is authentic, full of flavour and tasty. Best Italian trattoria in town. Don't miss it.",5

Enomania,global_foodie_fan,"March 6, 2014","Forget Noma and the Little Mermaid, THIS is Wonderful Copenhagen","I don't have a stake in this place but I wish I did but if I did I wouldn't ever go anywhere else in Copenhagen! It's now a must whenever I stop over and you shouldn't miss it. It's the very rare combination of sharply executed Italian food in a great atmosphere for not a lot of money. Incredibly, add to this a wine list out of this world at very reasonable mark ups, you really feel like a king (with your wallet intact) walking out of this place. The risotto with peas and sea scallop is Milanese style, al dente and can't be had better in Italy! even by Gualtiero Marchesi, the king of risotto (try him at L'Albereta in Erbusco). Don't miss but be warned, you can't just show up, book ahead to avoid disappointment.",5

Enomania,HelloBalou,"December 2, 2011",Amazingly good,"We had the 4 course dinner with the wine menu. It was excellent. One of the wines I first thought was not as good as the others - but when tasted together with its food I had to surrender: it was an excellent choice. A little warning if you are picky: there is only this one menu, you can coose 3 or 4 courses plus as extra cheese. As a starter on the house we were treated with homebaked foccacia bread with the best olive oil I have tasted plus a choice of Italian charcuterie. They have just received a Bip Goumand and for Danish prices its absolute a bargain. There are only about 25 seats so make a reservation! The chef presented every course and the waiter the wines with a lot of knowledge. And yes you pay 45 DKK for the water (either plain or with gas), but there are refills for free.",5
Enomania,ofy,"November 28, 2011","Well-balanced ""wine & dine""","A cosy small restaurant not too far from Copenhagen Central (Railway) - 10 mins walk - close to the ZOO garden. Open in evenings - and I would think important to make a reservation. The menu is very limited - changed weekly I guess - and your challenge is only to decide the number of courses (4 at maximum plus coffee) and if you want to combine with the wine menu. I will strongly recommend to combine with the wine menu no matter how few courses you choose. The combination of the careful prepared menu and the careful selected wines makes this restaurant worth the visit. At first I didn't think the servings were as large es expected, but in fact the dinner was also in that respect very satisfying. So to be recommended - and by the way an excellent service.",4

Our little daughters are quite picky about food especially if it is new. Here they simply adored Smorrebrod with meat balls and with breaded flounder! The portions are generous for the price you pay compared to other restaurants in the city. Even though it is a Smorrebrod, it is a consistent meal. With my husband we had breaded flounder with shrimps, smoked salmon with stewed spinach and homemade curry herring. That was fantastic! Im not a fan of herring because of its strong fish oil taste. I dared to try and was surprised by the delicious combination of salty and sweet curry taste! It is my favorite Danish dish now.

Restaurant Komplet,Cogit8tor,"September 15, 2017",A Delightful Family-owned Danish Restaurant,"We were exploring Copenhagen for a few days before leaving on a transatlantic cruise and found this restaurant thanks to a good rating on TripAdvisor. It's close to Nyhavn, but less expensive than the restaurants there. It's a small place, with a few steps down from the street into its dining room. A couple runs the restaurant. The Danish husband is the chef and his Ukrainian wife--who speaks excellent English--handles the front of the house.",5

Restaurant Komplet,Bruno Eduardo B,"April 23, 2017",Wonderful experience ,"Very cozy place where I, my girlfriend and her sister were very well received by the owner, Julia. We wanted to eat something traditional and she made a suggestion and still taught us how to eat it in the traditional way. Julia was very kind and affectionate with us all the time, sharing stories and experiences. She made our experience even better. The Smørrebrød her husband prepared for us was delicious. This was the suggestion given by her. An great suggestion. As if it were not enough, at the end of the lunch Julia's husband, who is the cook, explained how we should carry out a certain tour we were looking forward to doing. The food was great. The way we were treated even better! I just regret not taking a picture with Julia and her husband.",5

Rather small and you walk down from the street into a basement. We met the best ever waitress Julia who is well versed in Copenhagen issues. We also had great Danish flavour and taste enjoying my warm veal liver in cream sauce with bacon, champignon and bacon. With bread and butter I graduated into the Danish taste. The restaurant has an antique look but very welcoming. Very well priced and efficient Julia.",4
Restaurant Komplet,KaroliinaP31,"April 3, 2017",Not worth the price,"We found the place by accident and decided to drop by to taste the local Smørrebrød. The place was nice enough, though could be cleaner and I don't recommend a visit to the toilet. We ordered a plate of different smørrebrød toppings for 109 DKK each, and some, like the fish and tartar sauce were quite good. However the herring had an awful lot of vinegar and had apparently been warmed in a micro, and the mushroom salad had no taste whatsoever. Also the bread and cheese were the normal dark bread and emmental you can buy cheap from any given supermarket. We did not feel like we got our money's worth, but our bellies were full in the end nevertheless​. ",3

Restaurant Komplet,Mary P,"March 18, 2017",Fantastic meal,"During our weekend break to Copenhagen we visited Cafe Komplet after reading the reviews on tripadvisor' we were not disappointed. We were greeted by the owner who invited us to try the set 2 course menu. 129 Dkk. Well what a treat. Started with lobster soup which was to die for, so creamy and tasty served with wholemeal bread. Our hostess even suggested a beer to go with it, hornbeer Grist, which was exceptional with a fruity peach flavour. Now I like my beer but would never had picked that off the menu, but it really complemented the soup. We followed this with pork and pesto, baby potatoes served on a bed of cinnamon apples with a mushroom sauce. Again our hostess suggest a beer to go with it, hornbeer wiessbeer, quite a light German style craft beer which just brought out the flavours of the food. If you are going to Copenhagen then this has to be a place to try, you will not be disappointed. ",5

Restaurant Komplet,Julie L,"December 15, 2016",Typical Danish food with very friendly owners and amazing prices,"My husband and I were walking down the streets of Copenhagen hoping for an early dinner with authentic Danish cuisine. It was around 4:30pm and a lot of the restaurants were closed, but walked past Cafe Komplet and noted it was open. Then, the price of the special Christmas buffet caught our attention (79 DKK/person) and decided to give it a try. They offered fried fish, fried pork, baked pork, pickled herring, meatballs, sausage, cheese, fruit, potatoes, fresh bread and a variety of other sides. The food was great, but our favorite aspect of this restaurant was the friendly owners. Perhaps it was because we were the only customers eating such an early dinner, but we enjoyed chatting with the owners wife about her favorite things to do in Denmark. She gave us a lot of friendly help and advice for our time in Copenhagen. If you're hungry, on a budget, and want to support kind, hardworking people then we highly recommend Cafe Komplet.",5

So we couldn't eat anything - but the fries turned out to be on our bill! I am glad we didn't trust the chaotic water and better double-checked.

Ordered the bbq burger but didnt enjoy it particularly. They had ok gluten-free options, but not on any of the pizzas, so in reality you can only order burger (which is served with a piece of very dark bread filled with nuts as the bun) or salads if you want gluten-free. Great staff and lovely atmosphere however. Enjoyed the dessert, a yuzu cheesecake. Is a good place if you want really healthy options. ",3

Nevertheless we were a little disapointed. The food was ok, the sweet potatoe fries were cold, baked too short and lacked a little salt, on the other hand the pancakes were delicious. The service was lovely but not capable to handle everything. We didn't get our meals at the same time, we had too wait an hour on a mango lemonade, and because of the concept that you order everything in the counter, it is very uneasy to sit and walk and draw someone's attention. Pricing is sometimes a little akward; the mango lemonade (mostly ice) is more expensive than a beer. Overall: it was ok, but slightly overrated. The unique selling point ofcourse of this restaurant, is that it's vegan. That's maybe also the reason for the big amount of positive reviews.",3

Souls,Ask J,"August 8, 2016",The first brunch I would actually spend time on eating,"My girlfriend, my daughter and I had heard about this place and thought it could be fun to check it out since we were in the neighbourhood anyway. This is a sidekick, but the problem with going out in Copenhagen if you truly love food is that the café/lunchtime offers are either takeaway or of a really poor quality. We have great restaurants indeed, but if you just want a decent meal without squeezing your pockets too much, there is really not that many options. Anyways, we sat down outside (we chose this option primarily due to our 7-month old daughter who is still not a “spoonstar”) where you could really feel that people were having a great time. We went inside to order, and here it was the exact same thing, it even smelled nice which is more than you can say about most bacon-smoking brunch places and the interior was in complete harmony. We ordered a brunch, a sandwich with potatoes and barbeque mushrooms and drank birch water. This is not an understatement to say that this was top notch. Since everything is vegan and organic we gave the food to our daughter as well (first time she got something we had not cooked ourselves) and she totally dug it. The “yoghurt” made from cashews, the bean mash, the fruit…. and so on. Go here and indulge yourself in the best vegan meal you will get at a restaurant/café/the-place-to-go-if-you-need-something-quick in Copenhagen.",5

Service was excellent; once, the wine arrived late for a course, for which the server was very apologetic, offering an extra goodie from the wine list as free compensation.

Geranium,DruryS,"October 30, 2019",Beautiful Restaurant with Rooms for Improvement,"Five stars for the beautiful decor, service, and food presentation. Unfortunately, the taste of the food was rather mediocre; None stood out. I’ve been to several three stars Michelin restaurants; and I always remember some dishes that I had and felt as If I ate something amazing without looking at photos that I took. While 16 dishes could entertain your eyes for food art, but at one point it became tiresome if each waiter or two had to explain every dish; as a result, we could not relax- as if we had to listen to colleagues’ presentation in workplace. Another thing, that we notice, some of the waiters always open with “guys” to address us before explaining the dishes. It’s fine dining based on the price and presentation - confusing goal. Furthermore, some dish presentations were overkill and the staff had to inform to not eat the garnishes; such as, the flowers, the sticks, the stones, etc.... again too much explanation like going to a museum. What’s the point of putting such flowers it they were not edible? Why not use edible garnishe ",3

The only recent experience that compares was at L'Enclume in the UK, not the Fat Duck, or Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, both of which were very good but not in this category. The wine list was exceptional, the service perfect, and we hope that the absence of Coke Zero doesn't turn too many people off! :-( Hah! Drink water, I did.

Geranium,jameshT4626LW,"May 6, 2019",One of the best restaurants in the world,"We've had the great pleasure of eating in some wonderful places. Top rated, michelin stars including many of the Top 10 of the San Pellegrino lists. The day before, we ate at Noma, and yes, it was completely extraordinary. And whilst Noma deservedly earns its reputation through the foraging menu of secrets and the unknown, Geranium deserves it through sheer delight in taste. Every single thing we ate or drank was bewilderingly delicious. It carries as much mystery and magic in its presentation as the best, but it really does delight at the taste. For me, this is one of the Top 5 we've ever eaten at and we can not recommend it enough.",5
Geranium,schmidtmg,"April 30, 2019",Top-notch dining at every level,"We went to Geranium with high expectations - these were all me and even surpassed. From the moment of arrival to leaving three and a half hours later, it was a memorable dining experience. Our daughter (10) was asked whether she wanted an adaptation of the 16 course menu, but she chose the full menu and was delighted to have done so. The menu consists of 16 bites and small plates, with beautifully balanced flavours and superb ingredients. The wine list is among the largest I have seen (Robuchon au Dome in Macao excepted), and you find wines of great rarity (and the price to match) here. The first vintage of Screaming Eagle will ruin anyone but an oligarch, but the Kongsgaard Chardonnay 2013 we had was superb. Very good also was the glass of Ridge Syrah I had with the lamb course. Service is superb, the waiters and apprentices knowledgeable about every dish. The sommelier gave us a tour of the premises and impressive wine cellar. Overall this was one of the 3-4 four best dining experiences I can remember....... upon return home, I looked for a retailer who has Kongsgaard in its 'assortiment' and ordered a few bottles....",5

Geranium,S W,"March 31, 2019",Superb Nordic Three Star,"Geranium offers a warm, friendly atmosphere and an exploration of Nordic cuisine that is brilliantly conceived, beautifully executed and a pleasure to enjoy. The staff is excellent and the restaurant is notably generous in providing for the welfare of their guests. The tasting menu begins by laying out the pure, distilled, fresh flavors that are a hallmark of Nordic fine dining, then builds on them to introduce layers of complexity with varied levels of flavors and texture. The delicious food is both familiar and new, subtle while inviting thought and exploration. The world class wine list offers a selection of wine pairings, some of the best I have seen anywhere. On the higher end (yes, this can get very expensive, but in line with current prices for genuine “rarities,”), some once in a lifetime wines are on offer. Prices are high but comparable to other “best of the best” experiences (I see this as a category rather than there being only one at the top) in a very expensive city.",5

Geranium,otheroulli,"January 10, 2019",Professional yet warm experience with very good food and great staff,I liked the food very much but not every dish which I messaged the restaurant my thoughts on this. That being said this is a nice restaurant with a great ambiance. Wear something nice and expect to stay a while. Expect a high bill as Denmark is pricey. Nice touch with tour of wine and kitchen. Friendly but professional staff. Knowledgeable wine experts. I basically did not want to pay those exorbitant prices for a pairing so I picked two wines and an after dessert wine. It was under 100 bucks as I told them the max I wanted to spend. I have no qualms about this. Lol. They found excellent wines to pair with the tasting menu. One friend is dairy free and they were aware and had tasty alternatives. He had a cider and it was huge that his wife split it with him. Another cost effective way to have a libation without breaking the bank on drinks. I do wish they had a cheaper wine pairing like el cellar de can roca. Need to be more aware of wiping crumbs from the table. They will call a cab for you. Overall a much more welcoming experience than my greeting at Noma and it’s sister restaurant. Chef who even though he seemed a bit shy indulged me with a photo which I appreciated. I would go back if in Denmark. ,5

The executive chef was being interviewed for a Japanese publication while we were there, and the assistant head chef was experiencing the food at the table next to us. All the courses were quite unique and good (we had the Winter Dream menu; beetroot made many appearances). Throughout, each course was explained and we met most of the staff this way.

Geranium,Christian3333,"September 28, 2018",Presentation over taste with average ingredients ,I could see a lot of efforts were spent on the presentation unfortunately didn’t translate into taste. The ingredients were not expensive and the portions were way to small to call it a course more like 17 bites. There is no red meat in all the courses which is kind of a waste with such extensive wine list. The only meat dish was chicken which was disappointing since I’m paying almost 300 euro per person for the tasting menu. Service was good and a nice little tour of the kitchen was interesting. I remember may be 3 out of the 17 courses and one of them was dessert. The rest was bland or the ingredients didn’t go together or pointless. For that price definitely expected more. ,2

Geranium,EBayArchaeo17,"May 26, 2018",Exhausting Pageantry,"At a certain point through the meal, Geranium becomes a caricature of a caricature, far more interested in the pageantry, the choreography, and the props than the flavors. How many absurd gadgets can they bring out? Break the top off a wine bottle using fire and ice? Check. An exhibition of making a coffee at the table? Check. A wine list the size of a Bible? Yes. It does not add to the food; it detracts from it. The dizzying array of staff makes it feel more like 'Cecil B. Demille Directs a Movie about Dining' than dining itself. Towards the end of 16 courses, fatigue sets in. How many more jellied, smoked, brothed shellfish dishes can there be? Geranium quickly becomes repetitive and leaves one longing for a simpler, more streamlined process, free from the visual clutter that defines the interior of the restaurant. As food-as-art, as food-as-spectacle, Geranium excels. They don't have to prove themselves to anyone, and their hard work and passion are evident. Yet I won't really remember the flavors, only the rigmarole. At Geranium, the production comes first, the food comes second.",2

Wild garlic dish was my favourite but with so many beautiful courses is difficult to pick any one dish as other highlights included the beetroot and scallops or the porcini mushroom and truffle soup. We dinned at the Chefs table and had a unique insight into the workings of a three Michelin start establishment. All the chefs worked like a well oiled machine yet took time to answer our questions about the dishes prepared.

A little far from the city center, it is in an office-like building. The space is amazing with an open kitchen displaying Chefs plating the food. Perhaps a little too friendly service (when they start asking you what you do for work, it gets a little invasive), they often forgot our table with our wine or even the cheque. The food was different; a little too progressive to a point that you would miss the lamb if you didn't know it was really the main course.

Its all insanley expensive but heh ho, its a special occasion. The various courses are served by the chefs and each dish explained. What is really ncie is that everyone is prepared to engage in conversation. The wine is regulalry topped up throughout the evening and water is readily available. During the red wine paring we were approached by Soren, a table complete with blow torch, a pair of medievil tongs and a bottle of wine! Look at their web site to see what happens.. Great spectale. They also brought us another bottle and talked us through it only for us to spot that it was from our wedding year. Very nice touch. A tour through the wine cellar and kitchens followed together with a picture with all the chefs. As for the location, we liked it. The fact it was high up gave great views and once you are in there, you could be anywhere. Staff were all outstanding. Soren and Rasmus were wonderful and the food was stunning. The cost...? Well although it was th emost I have ever paid for 2 meals ever, I ask myself would I pay £150, £200, £250 per ticket for a concert or a play at a theatre? Well yes I have.

That sense was quickly overcome by the kindness of the staff, the variety of dishes, and the overall experience. This not a stuffy restaurant. The staff is so down-to-earth and extremely passionate about food. For solo travelers, you can tell they’re used to them and make sure that you’re comfortable and happy. There’s not a lot of lag time between dishes so you don’t get bored. About the food.....amazing and creative! You experience flavors you’ve never eaten before and interesting combinations that you know required a lot of testing! You’re eating well-tested dishes that portray a theater of foods, to say. The experience is 3 or so hours and also includes a tour of the kitchen by a member of the chef’s team, and for me, included a group picture with all of the chefs. In the end, the restaurant provides you a menu of everything you ate and drank which includes a stamp of the day you went there. I’ll always remember this dinner.

It was our first experience of this kind (a multi-course meal with no menu) and it was almost perfect. We arrived in Copenhagen that morning and had lunch reservations at Geranium. The view from the dining area is restful even if the restaurant is located in a soccer stadium. You do not see the stadium from the restaurant but instead view a park like area with many trees. We were served a 17 course meal, plus an extra desert to celebrate our anniversary. We loved almost every course. They made accommodations for my shrimp allergy. Prior to our last course, we were given a ""behind the scenes"" tour of the restaurant. The entire experience took approximately three hours but at no time did we feel that we were rushed. We did not select either their wine or juice options, but, instead, enjoyed their semi-low alcohol sparkling wine, which was light and pleasant and not sweet at all. Almost everyone was extremely helpful and they arranged for a taxi for us at the conclusion of our meal, even though a soccer game was scheduled for that evening and many fans were already arriving at the stadium. So why only almost perfect....one staff member's overt reaction to the gratuity. As noted by others, this is an expensive experience, approximately $350 per person, without wine or juice option.

The seeweed was disgusting. The fish was very good, but it was basically the only thing that was tasty and not enough to get anyone full. I like eating at michelin restaurants, and we wanted to impress our clients, but nobody was impressed and we fet ashamed that we took the to such a dissapointing place. I have heard good things about Geranium, so it was really sad. Coffee was good, place clean and beautiful, the only reason for me not govong it 1 star. The staff was in class of a downtown grill, really, really bad. We went out hungry and ordered room service at the hotel when we got back. Thats bad! So, no, I will not return, ever.",2

The only hiccup was that we skipped a course - the razorclam - and had to draw this to the attention of staff. Such was the quality of the whole experience, however, that this barely mattered.

Maybe a little too pretentious for our tastes, and nothing wowed us in the menu. The presentation and ingredients looked and sounded amazing, but the taste didn't live up to the expectations. Lovely decor with great views, but so strange that there are no curtains to block sun. We were uncomfortable with sun while eating, we actually asked to switch our table after we arrived. We noticed many many other guests switching seats at their tables or just squinting and being uncomfortable. The staff seemed annoyed that we mentioned this. We did receive a tour of the wines and kitchen, but we were the only table to be escorted by our waitress, instead of one of the chefs, so we never received interesting information or explanations. There were people in the kitchen available. I certainly do not mind the expense or having to give a deposit, and we had similar dinners during our stay in Copenhagen, but I expect a great deal for that, and I feel that Geranium did not deliver.",3

My husband and I have never been to a three star Michelin restaurant or any rated ""World's best"" restaurant so I really didn't know what to expect but we were in Copenhagen for our honeymoon so we made reservations for dinner (not realizing exactly how expensive it is!). I also mistakenly made the reservation for a different time than I had planned but the restaurant was more than accommodating in seating us. From there, the service and meal just got better and better! We were even treated to a glass of champagne for our honeymoon. Each course was more delicious than the previous (and the first may have been the best thing I've ever eaten). The wine pairing was perfect and all the staff were so knowledgeable and friendly. We were even treated to a tour of the kitchen afterwards. We loved every minute of the experience (3.5 hours!) and will remember it forever. Thank you!! Would highly, highly recommend!

It was, quite simply, the best meal we've ever had! The food was remarkably innovative (which food items were used, styles of preparation), the wine pairings were the best we've ever had, and the service was impeccable. Opt as we did for the ""Wines for Summer Universe"" pairing because it's hard to imagine the other, more expensive, wine pairing could be any better. It's hard to pick favorite items because they are all so different from each other, yet all have a wide variety of flavors (some we've never experienced) that mesh beautifully.

Every morsel, of every course, carefully crafted to both taste and look exquisite. The sheer skill of those who infuse flavour and beauty into each delicious mouthful is staggering. Whilst the entire experience is totally 3 star, the staff, who are exceptionally well informed, managed to combine the grace and grandeur of this type of dining with a friendliness and humour that only serves to enhance the whole, truly wonderful treat!

The presentation and micro detail of each dish is beyond imagination but what amazed us was that the tastes that followed stood up to if not exceeded what you saw with your eyes. What makes Geranium and Danish fine dining so refreshing though is that it is served with candid relaxed care. In New York the experience would have been ruined by pretentious hosts and servers that made you feel perhaps unworthy. Not here. Each dish was brought by a chef with a smile and sometime a laugh and time for short discussion if you cared to engage. I commented on this fact with one of the servers and her perfect ironic response was ""its just food - we can't take it too seriously"". In short, worth every penny to flow through this wonderful experience. I will remember it forever.",5

It was an amazing experience, and the small dishes were all presented as pieces of art. There are some drawbacks to this, for example that it is nearly impossible to serve warm soup (or anything else that has to be warm) in such small portions. However, I am of the belief that warm soup should be really warm, and cold soup really cold. Nothing in between as this really was. For me, the concept with an open kitchen and millions of waiters and chefs running around in the restaurant does not work. I prefer the opposite - one single waiter and a very calm and relaxed atmosphere. It was not unpleasant at all, but just not a preference of mine. We were offered the table very close to the kitchen, but I was very happy that we declined! The food was obviously incredible, and minuscule dishes kept coming. The razor clams were unbelievable, as so were the dill scallops. Such an incredible amount of focused work go into each dish, and the Michelin stars seem absolutely well-deserved. Maybe I'm just not a Michelin person.

Service was impeccable all evening: from the welcome cup of champagne, to the presentation of each dish, a work of art in itself, and the careful and unpretentious explanation of the ingredients, process and the appropriate wine pairing (which we gladly accepted). The menu lists about 20 dishes, all small, and all incredibly well thought through, prepared and presented. There were accompanied by nine different wines. We have dined in most Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, New York, Budapest, Italy and Japan, but this was such a display of innovation, creativity and industry, we were thoroughly impressed. The Jerusalem artichoke leaves with walnut oil and rye vinegar was a revelation. The Mackerel with horseradish and Dill juice kept us guessing while we delighted in the harmony of flavors. The celeriac with scallop and trout was divine! The vegetables with oyster, cauliflower and elderflowers didn't correspond to what we imagined on paper: it was much better. The king crab in cabbage was amazing as were the desserts and sweets. I stopped counting after a while, but I'm sure there were several amuse-bouches interspersed in between the listed dishes and each dish was presented with such joy and pride: you could tell the staff was very proud of being part of this team. I often have issues with wine pairing and disagree with some (and sometimes all) the selections. This time, I was delighted with every choice. We left grateful for the few hours of pampering and culinary delight and will remember this dinner for many years to come.",5
Geranium,Chelsea Z,"October 31, 2016","Just like everything Scandinavian, perfectly considered.","Geranium is by far one of my best tasting experiences. The food melts in your mouth with every bite. The flavours have all been very well considered, and at the end I was so satisfied I didn't want to return to reality. I did the degustation menu with matching wine. I would recommend just doing the degustation menu and ordering your own alcohol as you see fit. A lot of courses meant a lot of alcohol, and for me it was too much wine in the end to truely appreciate the well crafted cuisine. But other than that silly decision on my part, the food was outstanding, the service impeccable and the space was lovely. Highly recommend it if you're in Copenhagen and want to treat yourself.",5

In addition to that, I was a single guest and seated at the ""Chef's"" table which was a small circular wooden table that looked like it was from ikea situated in the back corner of the restaurant facing the chefs prepping the dishes.

I do want to carry on about how incredible the total experience for us made Geranium shine and really did feel like we wanted to hug everyone good-bye on your way out! The Welcome - elevator doors open and the warmest smile and familiarity in tone of voice instantly reassures you'll be well taken care of. Table: Not a sourpuss in the entire parade of folks who bring each course. Warm, funny, self-deprecating. A surprise after seeing them so serious in the kitchen, plating and taking direction - shear joy & pride when they presented at the table. It was infectious, it made us happy and glad we were came. At the end of dinner it was suggested we take coffee in the lounge. My first reaction was, ""really, the dining room is so great""...of course we said yes and to our surprise, the transition to the more intimate & romantic lounge was perfect. With fresh coffee being pressed table side, an after dinner Brandy in hand, the fire, the murmur from the dining room, we never wanted to leave. When we finally did, the additional touch of receiving a covered print-out of the menu (Fall), wine and juice pairing along with the other wine the Sommelier generously shared based on a Spanish wine we had tried and loved, was the perfect keepsake. I'm so jaded I was surprised at how sweet I thought it was. Car service was arranged and the driver came up to us. Perfection. Yes, we loved the food, but we really loved that the Geranium team knows that this is a special night and made all the right choices to make it just that! Thank you!",5

But each dish is small to very small and you never feel as if there is too much. The tastes are amazing - delicate and subtle. The explanations given are very much part of the 'show'. We had the wine menu, 7 superb wines that fitted perfectly and which were well explained. Altogether, an experience not to be forgotton! BUT, when it comes to the price, you wonder if you will dare to return. The food menu was 1,800 DKK per person and the wine menu was 1,400 DKK per person. That means 200 DKK per glass of wine - high even in Scandinavia. Be careful about extras: one of our party had a glass of champagne to start with and that cost 500 DKK.

Geranium,MobileDane,"May 25, 2016",21 or 18 dishes? The wines are the best part,"My expectations were at the highest as I entered the spectacular panorama at Geranium on a lovely spring evening, my second visit, after a truly fantastic night with family there three years ago. Now the place even has the three stars, and this time I was alone, in good shape and with a total focus on the pleasures to come. And it was a great experience, the place is magic, the food innovative, beautiful and sometimes ridiculously tasty, the wines out of this world, and the service… well the service is good but in my opinion the weakest point, actually. When you have so much time for yourself you can notice things more, and with the high level, high ambitions and high price of Geranium I think is fair to be critical if you experience things that does not please you so much. First, the menu and the oral introduction promised 21 courses, including several snacks. In fact it was 18. Does it matter? Yes, because nearly all of them are really small, several just a bite, not just the snacks but many of the starters too. No mistake, nearly everyone is a delight for eye, nose and/or palate (with the exception of my first starter, a novelty containing smoked oyster with an odd concentrated taste that I could simply not finish even if it was 2-3 bites only, and I am quite used to harsh North Atlantic fare). But only after three hours or so when I finished the final main dish before deserts, a really good pork serving, did I feel I would be able to leave the place without yet feeling a bit hungry. That and partly the desserts saved me. But just barely; I could certainly have eaten more, if more had been offered. I asked for a cheese selection or trolley as extra, but that is not available. Somewhat strange for a three star in a cheese loving country, but cheese was used in one of the dishes and maybe master chef finds this to be enough. I cannot praise the wine selections by sommelier Søren Ledet enough, though; that and the visit to his cellar surely made my evening; I especially can’t forget the super Tuscan accompanying the pig, and the delicate Veltliner Eiswein with the sweets. With so much to drink I usually find something to complain about (!) but nope, not his time. I would trust this man with my Lamborghini or my daughter, or both, if I had any. As for service, with lots of educated personnel orchestrated to make everything work you are of course generally served well but to me it seemed sometimes quite mechanical and not so customer-focused. They like to explain things to you, but are must less prone to listening, or responding to requests. I was sitting clearly visible by the window in the middle of the room but at least a couple of times had to wave my full arm (mostly in vain, actually) at waiters racing right by but not responding to smiles, slight waves, or ‘ahem’s. In one case if I could get a dish (the pork actually) gone completely cold before it hit me replaced. I could, but it took quite some effort to get it into the battle plan. Especially one (Danish, like me) waiter was very self-assured; you could sense she had many things going on, and not too interested in serving someone like me (starting her own place on the side, or releasing a fashion brand online, perhaps?) The foreign waiters seemed more professional and friendly, playing their part better. It is not a given, though, I have experienced the most wonderful charming, effective local waiters at other Copenhagen restaurants, and also at my previous visit to Geranium. Maybe this is just a lesson not to go alone to G, or if you do, bring your mobile device for entertainment, rather than hoping to be charmed by the crew. 21 or 18? They said to their defense that the three small after sweets count individually, to me that is a bit like cheating. With no cheese I asked for an after dinner drink, hoping maybe for some more small extra bites, but was told ‘we don’t do drinks’. OK, I should probably have been explicit about a whisky or a brandy, but maybe they wanted to get rid of me? When exiting I had the nerve to complain a bit about it to another waiter and I was offered a drink on the house (so they do have them…) and more deserts but at this time I was done with Geranium. I nevertheless left in a wonderful mood and took my bike to the nearest pub for a beer and some chips, and nice chat with folks there about my excellent, yet slightly, what is the word, glossy? experience at Geranium. I will be back, though, if I can find the money: The entrance! The wines! and The ‘kulmule’!, which is by the way the best fish dish I ever had, period. But I just can’t make myself give the experience full five points.",4

Geranium,Pleonast,"January 16, 2016",Very wide range of dishes and tastes,"My wife and I travel a lot, and about twice a year we splurge on really good and often quite expensive restaurant visits. This time Geranium was our destination; a restaurant with two Michelin stars that came highly recommended both from friends and from reviews. In our experience, Geranium has several excellent qualities, and this includes the very friendly, but non-intrusive service, the locale with comfortable and spacious seating, and the sheer range and inventiveness of the individual dishes. However, we've had several both better and more memorable experiences at these types of restaurants before, so from us Geranium does not receive the very highest rating. There are two main reasons for this. Some restaurants in this category accompany some of their dishes with almost a ""performance art"" aspect; we've experienced liquid nitrogen in various forms, our table covered with fog, inventive use of light, sound or serving plates, or similar. This is not at all a requirement or expectation for us and it doesn't always work, but when it does work it can be quite spectacular, and it always makes the meal more memorable. At Geranium there was nothing like this; you got 20 really nice dishes basically all served in the same way. This means that Geranium depends entirely of the quality of the food, both the quality of each individual dish, and of the quality of the meal as a whole. Probably the most memorable aspect of the dishes at Geranium was how diverse they were, and how many tastes and taste combinations were involved. However, while all the dishes were good, there was really only one dish that for us tasted really excellent, as in ""Wow! I wish I could have more of this!"" (duck with truffles). None of the other dishes were bad or even mediocre, but for us they came across more as interesting than as extremely tasty. Another slight disappointment for us was the menu as a whole. At this level of restaurant they often have some underlying theme or principle; we've experienced restaurants where the common denominator for the meal was surprise or humor or nostalgia. At Geranium it was really difficult to see what the underlying principle was (if there is any); in some ways it felt like they had given 20 different chefs the job of ""make a really interesting little dish out of local raw materials"" and then these were all put together to form the menu. In some ways it felt like being at an art exhibition and seeing 20 different pictures from the same artist, with no (discernable) commonality in style, color or subject matter. The problem with all this for us is that when we look back at our 20+ meals or so roughly of this type, the meal at Geranium does not come across as very memorable. There was no gimmick that we'll tell our friends about, there were no dishes that were so spectacular that we'll try to duplicate them at home, and there wasn't any overarching theme that makes it easier to remember how all the dishes were somehow connected. This, coupled with the fact that Geranium is the single most expensive meal we've ever had and also that one of us actually got food poisoning after the meal (despite precautions in the kitchen this is unfortunately a risk with some ingredients so we're not blaming Geranium for this), means that Geranium for us is neither the restaurant that we would most like to go back to nor is the restaurant visit that we will talk most about to our friends afterwards.",4

The wait staff was friendly although we requested to speak to the sommelier and that wasn't done. The set wine paIring menu was shockingly mundane and pedestrian for the caliber of food. They clearly are more interested in the food than the wine which leaves the culinary experience a bit lacking. The interior is minimalist, the kitchen is open and interesting to visit. I didn't really care about the location or soccer field - that shouldn't really impact on the culinary experience. There wasn't a bad dish in the 20 served and we loved the food.I can only give 4 stars due to the complete lack of attention or care to the wine pairing - quite unbelievable for a restaurant of this caliber.",4

Geranium,Nikolaj H,"November 15, 2015","Classy, yet personal.","We had lunch here in october 2015. The tasting menu served is the same for lunch and dinner. From booking and entry to exit a very fluent and relaxed experience. Geranium is a 2** restaurant with a view overlooking a large park on the skirts of central Copenhagen, easily accessible. The cuisine is modern - somewhere between nordic and french. 2 stars well deserved for the amazing food alone when you compare with 1* restaurants in Copenhagen and the 2** AOC (comparable) and Noma (something else entirely). The only ""but"" is the price of a meal here, clocking in at a whopping 500 euro per person with wine pairings (and a glass of Champagne) leading to a minor gripe. At these prices I expect the wine pairings to match the food, but as I've seen at a few other gourmet restaurants who do in pairings, once or twice during the meal the wine just isn't quite up there. I suggest cutting back on quantity (they refill generously) to up the quality. Off course, if you have a deep pocket the wine list offers what you would expect from a restaurant such as this. Service was great and personal all the way. We were invited to see both the kitchen and the wine cellar which was fun.",5

To give them credit they had someone waiting for us at the entrance who escorted us all the way to the lift which took us up to the restaurant. As we got up they promptly too our jackets and umbrella and we were seated on a table with a view of the kitchen. They offered us some welcome drinks and a choice of having the Geranium menu which are the all time Favorites or the Seasonal menu which uses seasonal ingredients from that time of the year. We decided to go for the Geranium menu as it was out first visit. Well they started us off with some cheese grain sticks followed by burnt potatoes ….. both were perfectly balanced with taste & texture and both were also pretty unique. Next came the razor clams with seaweed chips accompanied by a creamy dip and caviar. What can i say except that everything just kept getting better. After this course they took us for a tour of the kitchen and introduced us to the Chefs and the staff which were from all around the globe and all passionate and highly innovative. In the kitchen they served us with a mini soup of wild mushroom served with quail egg and truffles which just hit the spot …… after which they asked if we would like to take a picture or two and then return to our table for the next course. Back at the table we were served with dil stones which had scallops inside with dil jam accompanied with horse radish and cucumber granite sorbet, a treat for the senses just incredible ….. next came hague with Finnish caviar with buttermilk and parsley and hague skin which was also a delight …. this was followed by a variety of breads and an apple and camomile tea juice …. a well needed break for the palette. After this came bio onions dipped in vinegar with elder flower and edible flowers accompanied with baby leak , cheese sauce and onion powder ….. the last dish before the desert was the stuffed chicken which came with salad stems and flamed to perfection with a sauce made from the chicken bones and skin …… before i go any further I have to say that this was the tastiest most flavorful chicken i have ever eaten in my life … If I had to describe it in one word it would be ORGASMIC!!!! After this came the bees wax ice cream with caramel bee honey and some flowery foam ….. followed by white chocolate layered with woodruff and candied prune and finally came a red berry crisp and pumpkin cake with chocolate eggs and sweet caramelized onion ….. like the title of the review … just too good to be true …. and before I end let me just say the staff were very attentive and knowledgeable which just took the experience to a whole new level!!!",5

Interesting and innovative but for flavour or taste and not just for the sake of it. The wine list was extensive and we were guided well. The other thing that made it for me as a couple was the ability to buy great glasses of wine by the 5 or 10cl using their Coravin technology (cork left in and air replaced with Argon). Every table was invited into the Kitchen Table for a course which was fantastic as it had an amazing air of calm and professionalism. Some dishes were genius in their conception like the onion and cheese broth or the lamb and pine cones but all were inspired. This ranks as one of the best meals of my life and yet was clearly Danish and not just another international menu.

How great is that! The presentation of these dishes were mere artwork, which makes it that much more exciting. So much talent in that kitchen. Each and everyone can open their own restaurants successfully. As beautiful each course was plated, the taste was phenomenal! One course, they brought us into their kitchen and sat us down with three bocus d' Or trophies on the table and we were able to see the magic that occurs each service and impeccable cleanliness of the kitchen.

From the freshest ingredients, mainly vegetables and seafood, the preparation and the excellent service Geranium it definitely deserves to be one of the best dining establishments in the world.

Geranium,daedus,"March 17, 2015","A memorable experience overall, but number and frequency of dishes discombobulated","My lunch with a friend was exquisite; the presentation was an exercise in elegance and a clear attempt to pursue some form of perfection. The atmosphere was so serene it almost hinted at a layer of sterility, but the view overlooking the park and the quick serving of dishes prevented too much musing on this. The young staff seemed to reverently serve and follow up each small dish with a curt nod and description that helped map out the experience. The open kitchen was fascinating to behold; the weapon of choice in seemed to be tweezers, picking in fine technique at the blades of herbs and various nordic vegetables. The food was tasty and complex. The mix of salt and sour and sweet with the textures that opened the mind to a quiet cacophony of impressions I have often applied at other fine dining spots. We had the juice pairing, which was sublime. Fresh seabuck thorn juice was clearly the rockstar of the five, but the other four were perfect companions. The only negative to the experience was speed at which we sailed through the 17 dishes (we chose the smaller, rather than the univers menu with 21) at such a constant velocity that I have trouble recalling the specific plates. The culinary details have since melted together. Dessert on the other hand, was served in the kitchen and provided an unique opportunity to chat with the sous-chef and view the operation--a most impressive one at that. All in all a special and tasty experience I would recommend if shelling out a couple of thousand kroner isn't a problem.",4

Stifle your squeals of horror at the prices; in fact, after deciding to forget about how much it was all costing, the meal at Geranium felt great value for a special occasion. Sure, the best part of £500 for two (including tip, which we weren't sure was de rigueur or not in Denmark but was definitely merited) is a lot, but when it's for a meal as sumptuous and perfect as this was, it compares well to, say, going to a cup final or expensive seats at the opera. Set against other restaurants in the city (we couldn't get into Noma, but tried several joints run by ex-Noma chefs - none cheap), Geranium blew the socks off anything else we experienced. There's a lot of fancy but disappointingly untasty cooking going on: new wave, new clothes-ish. By contrast, every morsel produced by Rasmus and his international team sent tastebuds zinging and marvelling (read other reviews for details). Each dish is a work of art, too. Incredible attention to detail and obvious love of ingredients mark out an exceptional kitchen - open for all to see (and experience while eating one of the multitude of dishes). All this was matched by a relaxed and attractive dining room, and a charming, knowledgeable and properly attentive waiting staff. Definitely one of the best meals ever.",5

The Head Chef presented us with two courses, we were invited into the kitchen to eat one of our courses and the hospitality was just fantastic. Let's talk food....Geranium is able to infuse gastronomy with flavours that do not confuse your palette. Having also eaten at Noma, one of the things I enjoyed most about Geranium is that i had an opportunity to taste new flavours combined/infused with known favourites. Everything was fantastic..I highly recommend!",5

The cuisine is inventive and the atmosphere, elegant. The staff were casual but professional -- something I appreciated. Overall, it was a wonderful time. The next day, however, I felt a little hungover because of the large amount of food and the exotic ingredients. I recommend dining here (or Restaurant Noma) while in Copenhagen.",4
Geranium,Martine A,"October 19, 2014",Did not live up the expectation,"Based on the reviews and its 2 m stars, I expected... something more? Certainly the food was good and the presentation very appealing, but it didn't stand out at all from other fine dining - except in price. I know this this Denmark, but still, the prices were astronomical and I left still feeling hungry. The juices were... mediocre. I enjoyed the chance to eat one course in the kitchen, but aside from that nothing really stood out to me about this place. We were left baffled at how highly it was praised. Keep in mind lunch can easily set you back $700 (without wine). Was this simply a one off? Or perhaps a case of the emperors new clothes....",3
Geranium,PS517,"October 16, 2014",New type of eating experience,"We opted for the universal menu for lunch without a drink pairing (I had champagne and my friend had a red).

The staff was warm and welcoming -- I have been to other Michelin star restaurants and have never experienced such professional yet not snobby service. One of our servers, Julie, went out of her way to put together a list of places for us to check out in Copenhagen and Malmo.

I could see and feel the care that was taken to ensure that every individual course was delicious and beautiful! The chefs and the staff are #1 in my eyes! I was even invited to sit in the kitchen when served one of the 4 dessert courses of my 22 course universe tasting menu! I dined alone that day but I never felt it. Likewise, how incredibly gracious of the chefs to agree to take a photo with me - in the kitchen, seated (where I had eaten my dessert) beside Chef Kofoed's Bocuse d'Or awards, with his entire kitchen staff!

The food has some extraordinary highs and some mediocre ones. From the 27 dishes we ate, we experienced some tastes and food we'd never had before and all the dishes are presented as pieces of art. We opted not to have the matching wine pairings which was very expensive but we had a wonderful bottle of white Burgundy and it certainly kept us going through the menu. The highlight is being taken into the kitchen, meet the chefs and get to experience the kitchen. Overall, it is a highly memorable experience with some knockout food.

So we booked dinner here, knowing very little about it. The setting is a little unusual, up on the 8th floor of an athletic stadium with views of both part of Copenhagen (not the central part) and a running track, but the interior was very nice and probably more spacious than most top restaurants. We had an outstanding view of the kitchen, which was only separated from the dining room by a partial glass wall. The dinner started with a rapid-fire series of “snacks,” followed by the extensive tasting menu. The dishes were amazingly creative, often works of art, but still delicious. They even invited guests to meet the chefs and actually have one of the courses in the kitchen! Service was friendly, yet very professional and polished. They made you truly felt welcome. We chose the juice pairings instead of the wine pairings since we don’t drink, and they were wonderfully unique and complemented the food well. Despite the large number of dishes, we were not overstuffed at the end like one can be at many of these top restaurants.

Geranium,Rachel K,"July 11, 2014",Unforgettable! Best culinary experience I've ever had!,"As the title suggests, geranium was singlehandedly the most amazing restaurant I've ever experienced. As a native New Yorker and currently living in Italy, I'm not a stranger to rgff (really good f*king food) and I must say from the food itself to the exceptional service, geranium topped my list. My friend and I got the full tasting menu for lunch with wine pairing. The menu is intensely robust and I would butcher my attempt to recollect each dish including the ingredients..regardless, the concept behind the food is marvelously Scandinavian. Fresh local ingredients, prepared fancifully with such precision to surprise the senses. The wine for the pairing was...not my favorite however. I appreciate the idea behind local wineries but it's like going to Italy for beer or Kansas for seafood. German wines are okay but I didn't particularly like them. Anyway, now for my compliments to the kitchen. They were gracious enough to let us in the back kitchen where each kitchen staff member greeted us and even let us take a ""family photo"" as cheesy as that sounds. I felt like a giggly schoolkid when the head chef stood next to us since he adorns the cover of ever Nordic cuisine magazine. I was really taken aback when they all agreed to do that. Now back to the restaurant, the service was so quick and efficient- with different servers brining different dishes and informing us how to eat each twig/ball/soup (yeah a lot of twigs and flowers). It was a 3 hr foodie paradise and I was so happy at the end I almost cried. Seriously. My mouth now refuses to accept anything subpar. But if I don't want to go broke and begging for money for this newfound addiction, I shall reserve geranium for another visit to copenhagen. All in all, it was AMAZING. Go! ",5

The chef (Rasmus) conjures magic from every-day foods, while his business partner (Soren) is an expert sommelier. The restaurant was voted as #42 best restaurant in the world recently and the Danish Restaurant of the year in 2013. Having visited Noma (the #1 on the Best Restaurant List), I can say that the ambiance is definitely better in Geranium and the reservation process far more customer-friendly than what Noma has. So, what do you get for $500? A tasting menu with 23 small-late items. Some of the more memorable were the bees wax ice-cream. If I were to go to Geranium again, I would probably choose the juice pairing as the juices they had were definitely intriguing, delicious and healthy!

And i think for Dkk 3000 a head ( thats including a very very average wine menu ) you deserve to have several dishes that leaves you speechless instead we ended the main course with chicken ( yes was very nice but still.. ) and Venison Tartare. Now I really like tartare and I really like Venison but it was more or less tasteless. Not a single person at the table ( we were four ) finished even half of that serving but no one asked why or if anything was wrong.. Now I still give the restaurant 4 out 5 as the snacks ( i think 8 different servings ) was nothing short of world-class and I really thought that we were in for a HUGE night. Unfortunately not. But many of dishes were very good especially the bread dish stands out ( as you only have one serving of bread ) and the presentation of the food was picturesque and service was excellent.

Maybe that´s because there was served more wine than food-I´m not sure. I also recall many cold courses. The service was ok, but I think it lacked finesse I would expect of such a restaurant. I can´t quite figure out why this place has two Michelin stars. Would I eat here again- probably not.

To me, the key to “comprehending Geranium” is that it is not really a restaurant, but rather a gastronomic theater. Therefore, expect a lot of action, movement, constant change of the scene, intrigue, amazement, and discovery. It is not a venue for a romantic dinner, you are never left alone. On the contrary, the show takes you to the sanctuary – the kitchen, where you can observe the action, sitting behind three Bocuses. The food was fantastic, the service choreography – impeccable. I only regret about my choice of juice paring (was too tempting – where else you get one?). Most juice-food combinations did not really work for me (before we reached hot dishes). Do not know about wine, but water can be the perfect background for the brilliant food dishes.",5

The restaurant is situated on the 8th floor in Fælledparken just outside the centre of Copenhagen and is very unassuming when you first approach it. Both my girlfriend and I can safely say that we had the best meal of our lives so far at Geranium for many reasons. The food was exceptional and that’s even compared to the other 2 Michelin star restaurants we’ve eaten at, however, it was the other touches that really made the evening truly special. As you’d imagine the waiting staff are faultless, but a lovely touch was that the chefs (including Rasmus Kofoed, the head chef) came out to present a number of the dishes from the 15 course menu. Another nice touch was that for one of the courses, they sit you in the preparation area of the kitchen so you can see how things are done.

Geranium,Alice-R01,"August 18, 2013",Great Option for a Special Occassion,"In anticipation of being in Copenhagen on my birthday I was looking for an outstanding restaurant. Unfortunately July limits your choices as many elite restaurants are closed during this time. Fortunately Geranium was open. I made reservations and then received an email noting if I failed my reservation I would be charged 150 euros/person. As were flying in on the morning of the reservation I didn't want to take a chance and cancelled my reservation. Upon arriving in Copenhagen on time I emailed the restaurant and asked if there still might be availability for my special occasion meal. They emailed me back promptly that there was and we went at 1230. The restaurant is located at the soccer stadium and our taxi driver wasn't too sure I knew what I was talking about. The restaurant is located on the 8th floor with a great view of the city and the waterway. We had the full tasting with the juice menu. They easily accommodated my vegetarian diet. I eat dairy and eggs. The meal was about 3 hours long. 1100Kr for the food and 500Kr for the juice tasting menu. About $286. It was a lot of fun. The food was very creative, and elaborately prepared and presented. The place settings are not as elaborate as say the French Laundry, and service was attentive, but a little scattered as there were different waiters and waitresses serving us. Towards the end of your service you are invited to go into the kitchen and observe. We were sitting next to the glassed in kitchen and watched. People asked for pictures with the chef etc. We were served one of the courses in there. It was nice touch. What stood out for me was the clear tomato soup, and the mushroom soup. The food was light and of course these places don't give you much per course. There was a bread course of little loaves about an inch long, otherwise no bread. By 6 pm my stomach was growling. We really enjoyed the juice tasting menu. Compared to the French Laundry, where I've dined a few times, the service was a bit lacking, but only because you got confused who was helping you. The food at the French Laundry is much richer also. My companion had the main regular tasting menu without any dietary restrictions and noticed this also. Dining in Copenhagen is expensive in general, so I didn't this this was overpriced at all. Would go again for a special occasion.",5

Tables spaced appropriately at a distance so that no conversations overlapped. The service was exquisite, with very careful attention to keeping the water and wine glasses filled at all times. Every course (21 of them!) was served on a different shaped plate. The head chef, Rasmus, helped to serve and explain several courses and the other co-owner, Storen, also stopped by to chat. Towards the end of the meal, we were invited (as I guess all guests are invited) to come into the kitchen to observe and to have a cup of cold tea of unknown but delicious origins.

We were surprised at the location, at the Parkens Stadium... but on the 8th floor there was no indication that we were in a stadium, as all the windows faced outward toward city views. The staff were very warm and friendly, not pretentious. We especially enjoyed being invited into the kitchen for one of the courses, where we were able to visit with a few of the chefs. There is a balance between great, real food and the amazingly creative experimentation happening in today's kitchens. Personally, I favor real food and prefer to know what I'm tasting. For the most part, Geranium kept with this integrity.",5

Geranium,Berlineric1963,"May 6, 2013",A once-in-a-lifetime experience!,"For a 50th birthday treat we spent a few days in Copenhagen. Friends assured us that we should eat at Geranium and not Noma, and because nibbling on bits of seaweed didn't appeal, we booked here and chose the full option menu with 22 courses and wines to match. Brilliant. The staff are all knowledgable and you can ask anything and the ratio of dinner guests and staff in the dining room is almost 1:1. The ""dragon with the girl tattoo"" (sommelier) puts on a bit of an attitude at first, with a bit of the misplaced arrogance of a first class cabin attendent (think Penny in ""Come Fly With Me"") but warms up later -- I suppose it's all part of the show. But it's not *just* show. The food is spectacular and interesting and weird, but in a wonderful, thought-through way. The pairing of food and wine are sublime and the entire experience was worth the eye-watering price. Save up and do this.",5

You can really feel that they've thought of both every single dish and the combination of the dishes all together. Every dish is like a small piece of art, whilst being very tasty at the same time.

A lot of beautifully polished stones and small branches softening the clean lines of the dining room. Our table for 4 was close to the open kitchen and we could see the chef and assistants carefully placing ingredients on ever changing china as the courses went one after the other. Each course is just a few bites, but I was struggling to finish by the end of the evening. Among my favorites: a bubble of dill essence and frozen white chocolate snow. A few nits: there was too much moss with the halibut seviche and a couple of salads are repetitive. Service was more attentive at the beginning of the evening that when all tables became occupied. Because the courses are small, service is required at a greater rate that in a more traditional meal and there just weren't enough bodies. All in all, a worthwhile experience.",4

As well, we were on a two week trip through Europe, ate at many of the finest restaurants in Copenhagen, Rome and Positano and this was by far the most expensive.

I had looked forward to eating here for quite a while and changed my travel plans around to allow a dinner with our best friends here. The vote was unanimous between us: this place is not worth a detour by any means, even if its around teh corner, which it is not! Mainly this was down to service, wine and taste. The food is very pretty for sure but it is the epitome of style over substance. Nothing was really a homerun taste wise, the kitchen really does prioritise looks and innovation over taste.Out of 15 ish servings NOTHING was memorable, a few were ok and a few were downright awful. The service was sketchy at best. Clearly Soren knows what he is doing, however there is a certain arrogance over the service, assuming the guests are clueless and I dot get the feeling they care about feedback whatsoever. The sommelier has the charisma of a box of stones, she refused to tell me the exact wines in the 1900 kroner ""exclusive wine menu"", a lucky dip approach I assume, unheard of,. Having spend two nights in Paris earlier in the week eating like a king, it was striking how local and amateurish some of the service was compared to the world class career waiters you run into in Paris (and other places). And the wine menu was a joke, in very diplomatic terms. I really appreciate a place which seeks to serve bio dynamic, small producers, but not at the expense of taste and composure. The two sweet wines were fine but one wine was undrinkable and the only red was so short on the palate that I had to look twice to make sure it wasnt Ribena.Finally one was a champagne but without bubbles, thats like Gaga without the fish stockings, not very interesting. I am not a Master of Wine but like to think I can recognise good wine, this wasnt it.

This food is style over substance where taste has been forgotten in the search for ingenuity. So, we were served potato chips and seaweed, which had no taste at all, edible razor clam shell that amazed but did not deliver flavour and a bland, clear soup with balls of jellied ham that made us gag. Not that we knew any of this beforehand as the menu was handed to us, along with the price, in a sealed envelope once the first snacks had arrived and so it was too late to back out. £600 (when converted) for two people.

I had invited my brother and his wife along and we all went for the tasting menu including matching wines. The service was excellent, the lady paid attention to detail and there was nothing to fault. Furthermore, the food was above the level of many Michelin star restaurants that I have been lucky to go to. It was at the same level as the excellent Pollen Street Social, Texture, St John's which are great and it was better than the following 1 star michelin in London and Marbella: Skina, Locanda Locatelli, Zafferano, Rhodes 24...in other words, I keep raving to everybody about Geranium as it is unfortunately rare to get a holistic amazing culinary and service experience...therefore I will indeed return to this place...they deserve the best!",5

Geranium,Melbournep2005,"June 29, 2011",Disappointed,I went for dinner with my husband. Beautiful views from the windows as it was a lovely sunny day. We had 6 snacks in the lounge before moving to the restaurant. The snacks were very pretty and colourful but I can't say all the flavour combinations worked- this was to be the pattern of the evening- but the razor clams were love ,3
Geranium,SupremeSerendipity,"June 27, 2011","Step back people, we have a winner!!!!!","Geranium is by far my best culinary experience ever and that’s to say from many, many, many experiences at various yet some gazillion cuisines and restaurants around the world. I have usually witnessed a perfection in either taste or presentation, yet Geranium managed to achieve perfection in both that some Michelin star restaurants like AOC can learn a lesson or two from. The food at Geranium is not only beautiful, the taste is unsurpassable, the different textures are intriguing and the precision is awe-inspiring. It is not easy to compare Noma with any other restaurant in the world, but after eating at Geranium I can say that it is just as good as Noma in respects of a total dining experience. The only area where Geranium lacks in perfect precision in service compared to Noma, it makes up for in friendline ",5
Geranium,ccthevet,"June 6, 2011",Go see Noma or AOC instead ...,"After having pre-ordered the ""large"" menu including the wine menu I was quite disappointed to realize that this dinner consisted of only a long row of appetizers - (read: very small portions) with only tiny amounts of meat (chicken/mackerel/Norway lobster) ... and I did absolutely not intend to go vegan. Moreover the ""wine"" menu included several types of beer and ciders ... things you can a lot cheaper in almost any cafe in Copenhag ",2
Geranium,LaG_Cph,"June 2, 2011",Not impressed....,"While perfectly beautiful food, too expensive and too small portions!!!!! 
Very strange choice of beer and wine to the courtses.... I don´t drink beer! And when you choose a winemenu.... I don´t expect get beer!!!!!!

Over all way to expensive!!!!!!!",2

Geranium,batravn,"May 19, 2011",Absolute world class restaurant - But bring the big credit card,"Having been to Noma just 2 months previously we had a chance to make a direct comparision between the two most hyped and celebrated restaurants and head chefs in Copenhagen: Rene Redzipi as no. 1 on the Pellegrini Worlds Best Restaurants list vs. Rasmus Kofoed, winner of the Bocuse D'or competi ",5
Geranium,ChrisA9,"April 12, 2011",A wonderful experience,"We had the 7 course menu with one bottle of wine (we couldn't afford the wine pairing which would have cost the same as the food) and the juice pairing which we shared between 3 of us. We did have the extra cheese course, plus one extra glass of red wine to go with the meat course and the bill came to £200 each. I've never had such an expensive meal, but the meal took 3 1/2 hours and I didn't regret spending so much in one evening. My criticism would be that I thought the juice was too expensive especially as they weren't exactly generous with their servin ",5
Geranium,Yomura,"March 17, 2011",Great Meal and Views - Watch out Noma!,Our Danish friends organised this meal after we discussed Noma in length during our meal at el Bulli. They argued that they prefered Geranium to Noma and that we had to try it - I didn't quite expect them to get a table two days after our discussion and we found ourselves flying to Copenhagen for a meal a couple of months lat ,5
