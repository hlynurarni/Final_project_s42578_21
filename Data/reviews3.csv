Skagen Fiskerestaurant Illum Rooftop,BusySteph,"March 9, 2020",Great food,"Few days sightseeing from the UK. Fancied fish. Lovely rooftop area with a few restaurants. We chose Skagen and wasn’t disappointed. I had flounder which was lovely with lashings of prawns. Hubby had fish and chips but it was a couple of different types of fish deep fried with lovely chips and sauces. I had baked marzipan for pudding, again lovely and hubby had chocolate cheesecake which was enormous and lovely too. Great, quick service. Not cheap but I’m worth it! ",5
Skagen Fiskerestaurant Illum Rooftop,Vizzage,"January 30, 2020",Wow! Friendly and fishy!,"On an evening in Copenhagen wondering about looking for somewhere to eat, I asked someone where’s good, and was pointed in the direction of this restaurant, so I gave it a go - and it’s amazing. I have literally just eaten the nicest fried plaice I’ve ever had, washed down with two lovely glasses of claret. And the manager / owner came up and asked me how everything was and told me there was a band playing later, and, loving music I said I’d definitely stay for that, so she organised me another glass of wine - on the house! This place is really bloody lovely - stylish yet comfy, full yet somehow you feel secluded and well-catered for, buzzing yet relaxing. I think I’ve found a place I’m going to return to every time I come to Copenhagen! Oh, and the staff were all really brilliant too - thanks to the woman who explained about all the fish options!!

Skagen Fiskerestaurant Illum Rooftop,Kirsten M,"June 17, 2019",Expected much more,I went to Skagen on the recommendation of my friends. First I tried to order the seafood platter but the restaurant was out of mussels (please note it was on a Monday evening). They mixed my order for which I got a beer for free. Then I ordered rib eye and it was one of the worst experiences that I had with meat. Not recommended. ,2
Skagen Fiskerestaurant Illum Rooftop,Alexus1976,"June 14, 2019", Skagen is not good,"The place is terrible. Sitting is very tight, it means very noisy. And if you a non-smoker you will be breathing with cigarette smoke coming from neighboring tables. Food is terrible for a specialized seafood restaurant. I ordered prawns as a starter and they were very small with a taste of boiled glue. My wife ordered scallop as a starter and it was not good at all. Two microscopic pieces of scallop on the plate surrounded with peas and fresh cauliflower. I ordered a bottle of still water, instead they brought 2 glasses of water without a bottle. I ordered Sauvignon blan and they served Pinot blan. ",1

Skagen Fiskerestaurant Illum Rooftop,maddyk604,"May 2, 2019",the worst customer service i have EVER experienced," i just went to this “restaurant” with a friend because i was really craving mussels. when we sat down we were rudely told to sit ar the couches instead of a table because it was farther away from them. my friend and i had to go up to the counter to order because the waiters were too lazy to come to us. when we ordered our food, i ordered a double gin and tonic. this is the drink i always have so i am very familiar with it and how it should taste. i could hardly taste the gin in a “double” and went to the counter to ask if i could have another single in it because i could not taste hardly any alcohol. he manager (woman with glasses and brown hair) was extremely rude to me and said if i wanted more i should order another drink. i told her that the drink was expensive and did not want to order another drink when the original was not made properly. this business clearly does not understand customer service 101. always make the customer happy. she was very curt and rude to me and i will NEVER be going back here and I hope that people who read this don’t either. i’m completely disappointed and enraged with the amount of money i spent on a subpar meal and basically just tonic, no gin and was treated like crap.

The staff should have been alert and see our needs. Even when we arrived and were unsure of where to go and how to get service, there was really no one who volunteered to help. Maybe they were just too busy, but I was ready to leave then. The shrimp on the platter were very small, the crab claws either old or previously frozen, but the muscles were quite tasty.",3

When it was cooked it was thrust at me without a second glance as the waiter walked past. The burger itself was then barely cooked (clearly having been very quickly seared on the outside) and smothered in a vinegary ketchup (not on menu or on other people’s burgers of the same type at the table).

There were multiple mistakes on one of our orders. Additionally, we would order drinks and they would simply not come until we asked again. It looked as though we could see the server getting help putting orders in the computer. I truly hate giving average reviews, but this evening really was just that. We felt like if she was that new, maybe they should have kept a mentor with her to help her learn. Maybe she just wasn’t cut out for the server business. Not sure I will ever get the chance to come back to Copenhagen, but if I do I would consider trying one of the other locations. The atmosphere was nice, so they had that going for them.

Finally we were seated and it was clear that the restaurant was understaffed, just 2 members of staff working the tables was too much for them to cope with and understandably I guess they were pretty livid about it. Hence they weren’t to keen to give us a warm welcome. We waited a while to order, and drinks were taken after food as the waitress didn’t have a notepad when we finally collared her to order. Food arrived quickly but wasn’t the hottest meal i’v ever eaten and although its fashionable now to eat burgers a tad rare, this wasn’t cooked correctly in my opinion. It was still enjoyableish and you can tell the idea of a good establishment is there, I think we may have just hit it on a bad day for staffing.

You can definitely taste how fresh everything is with the burgers. I went for the classic burger with cheddar and it was mouth-watering tasty. My friend had the Brazilian burger where the burger had a piece of fried buffalo mozzarella in the middle.

Cocks & Cows Gl. Strand,blackchina3000,"September 29, 2018","Great burger, but...","Great decor. Great service. Clean place. And to top it off, very tasty food. The burger was near perfect. I say near because having been offered the choice of house bun and american, I chose american and maybe sgould have chosen the house bun. However, this is not a reflection on the establishment or the service as it was my own choice. The curly fries were perfect. Crispy on the outside and full of flavor. I ordered a side of Blue Cheese dip and it was also perfect. So why only 3 stars? I found my total bill to be rather on the expensive side for a meal of burger and fries. I don't know if it is because things are more expensivePIN Copenhagen (which I personally find that they are), or it's because this place has a higher mark-up than other burger joints. But in my experience, burgers and fries normally don't cost so much. I have worked in the industry for a few years myself and have made burgers a plenty from scratch. Having said that, I CANNOT fault the establushment or the staff for this, since it's a decision most likely made by the owners. What I can say is that if you are willing to pay or can claim this as business expense, it's a Great burger joint that won't let you down on taste or service. If you are on a budget, you can find less expensive options.",3

Cocks & Cows Gl. Strand,Helen R,"September 21, 2018",Great Burgers!,"Had our least expensive lunch at Cocks and Cows today, a chain of burger, beer & cocktail bars. Only 289 dkk for the two of us: burgers, beer (Royal Oko Classic), organic beet drink, and a side of fries. Everything was organic and delicious: beef patties large, perfectly grilled, portions more than ample, fries crisp and hot. I had my first Upbeet which is made with beets, ginger, lemon, and apple by a company called Frankly Juice. I loved it! My spouse says the Classic Cow and Royal Oko Classic (dark) beer make the perfect inexpensive lunch. I had the Onion Johnny burger which came with chili onions, onion rings (on the burger), tomato salsa, bacon, lettuce, mayo which was a little more.

Instead of being seated in the nice and cozy restaurant, we were led outside, passing a heated tent (for gods sake!) and finally seated in a very nicely decorated old barn. It was a really nice room very well suited for the larger size of our group, BUT the only heating available was with mobile electrical heaters. The result was that those sitting close to the wooden cracky door were freezing even with their coats and jackets on, while others were kind of grilled on their backside, as they were sitting below /near a heater. I had a good mix, deep frozen legs, but semi-grilled neck. I didn't care very much about the really good burgers and just wanted to get away from that place. Nice and friendly staff, good service.

A thin, kind of dry patty with very little taste as if it had not been seasoned at all, was my experience. The bread was also kind of dry.

First, they were very helpful in getting us a table outside (it was a hot day), so our dinner started off well. It was a busy day, so service was a bit slow, but everytime you would ask one of the waiters (for a menu, to order a drink or for an extra napkin) they would take care of it right away. The food was good. Nice, juice hamburgers, plenty of options on the menu. But then something weird happened. Halfway through our burgers the manager came to our table to ask us to move from a table that seats four to another table that seated two. I have never had such a request ever in any restaurant and became a bit upset with her, especially since she asked us to move mid-dinner (with our hamburgers in our hand!). To add insult to injury she did not show us any understanding (""I think it is a normal request and I am sorry that you feel different"" is not an apology), but once she picked up on our mood, she rushed inside and came back saying that she talked to the manager and wanted to offer us free drinks to make up the situation. In short: good food, active staff, but we will not be going back to a restaurant where they ask you to move to another table mid dinner and force you to walk there while holding the hamburger that you were eating in your hand, just so they can seat more people and make more money...",3

I also witnessed the same thing to two other solo diners. Once we got attention the service was friendly. Food was ok but the burger was dwarfed by the bun and the enormous amount of raw red onion. The salt and vinegar fries were good. The total for a veggie burger, fries a small cola was 173 dkr or about 23 euros. So not a place for cheap eats. When I asked for the bill they actually gave me the bill for the girl who was on the next table as well as my own.

Her response was abrupt, rude and when I explained that I had been watching her call and we had been sitting at the bar in clear view of her yet not seen her come over to our end of the bar since we sat down I was met with an argument at how I was wrong and it was another 45mins wait.

About 45min. It was not particularly busy but it did look like they had alot of takeouts going on. Anyway, it took ages.

There are many restaurants near main train station. Check around. Dessert was a clump of hard cheap ice cream.,1
Poonchai Thai Restaurant,hannahr81,"January 24, 2018","Great service, tasty food!",Quick and friendly service. Were shown to a table straight away and food came out efficiently. Both my friend and myself throughly enjoyed our meal and the portions were a decent size! I would recommend asking for extra spice in your curry if you like a bit of heat as I felt mine wasn't spicy enough for my liking however the flavours were great! ,4
Poonchai Thai Restaurant,santonez,"January 21, 2018",okay Thai near train station Vesterbro,I found the food a little better than average in that the sauces were not heavy. It did not taste like food I have eaten in Thailand. My companion said her chicken tasted strange. We were there for a later lunch. There was no lunch menu. The food was expensive - like $13USD for a plate of fried noodles. A Coke was about $8USD. I think all over Copenhagen you have to ask for service or they leave you alone - as a politeness thing.,3

The food is tasty, the waiters are nice, and the kitchen is efficient. The interior is typical for what you'd expect of a Thai restaurant not in Thailand. A bit worn and almost kitschy, but still nice and clean. The prices are reasonable, and did I mention that the food is tasty? A favourite for an unassuming dinner where the food and the company is more important than the place itself.",4

Poonchai Thai Restaurant,foodietraveler1818,"September 24, 2017",Horrible service and manager ,"Beware of this restaurant!!! It's over priced, too salty, but definitely the worst of all is the TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. They make you change seats after already seating you because they want to compact everyone together for new guests even if you've already started eating. One person at our table didn't get their food until the rest of us were done eating and when they got it, the order was wrong and the manager haughtily asked ""is this ok?"" after already putting the plate down and barely offering an apology. We took the food because we didn't want to wait any longer. While we were having dessert, they would reach all across the table and under our arms to pick up dirty dishes even if we were literally eating. When we paid, we just asked for an explanation of why the food was so delayed and they offered us a mere 10% off the one dish that came out 30 minutes late, it was also the cheapest dish. Then, when we asked if they could take 10% off the whole check instead, they got super aggressive and loud and said they didn't even charge us for water when we didn't even get water to begin with. They spoke Thai to the other workers complaining about us and the workers all gave us nasty looks the whole time we were paying. They also charge a 3.75% transaction fee for foreign credit cards and don't even advertise it till you get the receipt. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
Poonchai Thai Restaurant,Karin W,"September 17, 2017",Extremely expensive water,"We came here late one night and the first thing the staff said was that they close in 40 minutes. OK, that's good to know but not extremely welcoming. We ate one main course each (no time for more), and the food was good. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of sparkling mineral water. I got it in a glass so I never saw the bottle. I don't think there was one, I think it was soda stream-water. I had expected a bottle, but since it was late I didn't question it. Time to pay - they charged 50 DKK for one glass of water!!!! I asked the staff if the price really was right, and yes obviously so. The beer was cheaper .... Never ever go there! To charge 50 DKK for a glass of single water is outrageous!",3

We had green curry which lacked flavor in my opinion. But perhaps I'm being a snob. The restaurant ambience was nice overall.

To drink we had a pair of Thai ice coffees and two young coconuts - all of which were yummy as well. The portions were enormous and we couldn't finish everything.

We barely finish our food because of so much of chilies they used. We wanted to order something else then waitress said it is not possible as they have closed kitchen now.

Poonchai Thai Restaurant,Alex_Jing_Alan,"April 21, 2015",Way too expensive for Thai food!,"I have walked past this restaurant several times and it has always had plenty of empty seats. The pictures of the food on the windows looked great so we decided to give it a try. The staff were all Thai so that was a good indication that things may go well. When it did arrive we were pleased the food was very authentic. I have spent a lot of time in Thailand and have also taken Thai cooking classes in Thailand so I am quite capable of distinguishing authentic Thai food from the rest. This stuff was really tasty. We started off with some shrimp crackers and sweet chili sauce as an appetizer. Then we had Gwi Thiaw. I am not sure about the spelling. It's a beef Thai noodle soup commonly found on the streets in Thailand. This is probably their National dish. It was very tasty. We also hade Chicken Panang and Phat Si Ew. Not sure about that either. It's wide rice noodles friend with beef , vegetables and egg. For dessert we had mango and sticky rice. For drinks we had a large glass of sparkling water and a large glass of orange juice. The bill was right at $100.00 U.S.Dollars. This is high even for Denmark. We have eaten at other Thai restaurants and come out of it for around $50-$60 bucks. Because of this and only this I have given it a lower rating. You can spend less and get good Thai food in Denmark. I suggest you find another place where the price reflects what you receive a little better. Good food though, just not worth the money.",3

The food was excellent, and very reasonably priced. I like to try Thai Green chicken curry in a new Thai restaurant as I find that a good ""control"" dish against which to benchmark the restaurant. This one did not disappoint: it was clean, fresh, fragrant, just spicy enough (though there is the option to request extra heat) and it tasted fresh. and there was a good balance of beautifully moist chicken and crunchy fresh vegetable spiced with kafir lime leaves and thai basil I'd go back a second time if I were in the area.",4

We choose this one because the prices were affordable, and they had photos of the menu items to assist our selection. The service was very good, and we thought the food items were quite good.

It was fresh and very hot (temperature wise). We did request to split a plate and the servers took care of this very nicely.

It has a set menu if you want to try or an a la carte one. We went with the a la carte as we are not big eaters. The portions aren't very big so if you eat well you have to ask for entrees or dessert. They have several wines available as well a nice bar with several cocktail choices.

It's as if the concept doesn't really work for an odd-numbered table. But the service staff is very friendly, and quite efficient. The acoustics, however, are horrible. The place used to be a butcher's shop, and they seem to have kept the tiles from the butcher, which is quaint but does nothing for the possibility of hearing what your dinner companions might have to say. This is not a good place to go if you a more than a couple, as conversation is difficult.",4

Also charged DKK50 for ""vand ad libitum"" which turned out to be two smallish carafes of tap water - the second of which we didn't even ask for. The waiters were friendly and attentive though and the restaurant, in a former butchers shop, is an attractive setting.

Les Trois Cochons,Norwegian1975,"January 27, 2018",Great place but don’t forget your guests,Got a tip from a colleague to go here. Had a table saturday evening. We knew the street but not the place. Loving french bistros we loved the place as soon as we entered. Great place and got seated fast and ordered some G&T. Perfect. We had a great entree and the main courses was perfect as Well. But then we found ourselves without food or drinks and noone Even came to Ask if we wanted desserts or more to drink... we sat maybe for almost 20 mins and more before we finally caught the waiters attention and got a glass Of wine. Still no questions about coffee or dessert.... but we will come back but hope to Get more attention when finishing our food. ,4
Les Trois Cochons,erikzimm,"December 8, 2017",good food,"this is a nice place, decor is simple but solid, an old butcher shop with tiles on the wall. service is friendly and efficient. waiters know their wines - without pretending to do do - they've tried them. the puilly fuisse from eric robert was very nice - great with oysters. it also is the only place i've found so far in copenhagen that has gillardeau oysters - among the best of oysters for me. they were opened a bit violently with a few pieces of shell in the oyster but were oh so good! the turbot was splendid. really really good , nice fresh foam. really very solid. slightly undercooked. only comments: place is a bit noisy, and the menu is limited - probably on purpose. total bill 1500 dkk for 2, 4 glasses of wine included. overall - good recommendation, good quality, solid quality food, friendly and efficient service, gillardeau oysters that are worth a trip, great wines.

The 3 appetizers and 3 desserts are to be shared and are selected by the chef daily. There are 3 entree choices and we selected 2 of them and shared those since there were 2 of us. The food was excellent but it's a bot of a risk having the chef choose everything since you may not like those choices. It's a bot expensive for a (very) casual restaurant and it was noisy. Not a place for a romantic meal but it depends on what you are looking for. I would go again.,5
Les Trois Cochons,NathalyMir,"September 20, 2016",Average,"I was having dinner with a group of business friends, the menu was planned in advance, so I did not know exactly what to expect. Dinner consisted of three courses. For starters we had mussels, smoked salmon and beef tartar. The surprise was that two people shared starters of three plates. It was a bit awkward. Same was with dessert (profiteroles with raspberries, crème brûlée and grilled peaches). Main meal (lamb and ratatouille) was served for four people.

The food is good but it's really annoying that you have to choose the mains in pairs, meaning two people in the company have to choose the same main. It gets even more annoying when the mains arrive and are in no way, shape or form remotely difficult to prepare or plate up individually. That said, the food was well prepared and tasty. I had scallops, smoked salmon and tartare for starters, Beef tenderloin for main (I would have liked to be asked how it should be cooked, but it ended up being medium rare the way I like it, so never mind) and Creme Brulée, raspberry profiterole and grilled peaches for dessert. All in all the food was good, service okay. Not memorable but I wouldn't mind doing it again.",4

The restaurant was very busy this evening and it was 100 degrees inside. Everyone was sweating. The waiter was unbelievable slow and poorly trained. We spent 45 min just waiting for water. Once the wines were ordered he dropped the bottles of Red and White on the table and walked away. Never once in any establishment, good or bad, have I ever seen a waiter not pour the wines. We spent $3,800.00 Kr on our meal that evening and just expected better service. The food was dropped delivered in the same rushed and rude manor. What arrived at the table did not match the service. The food was impeccable. The course starters of Cauliflower with ceviche type scallops were a favorite, we additionally ordered the Foie Gras which was heavenly. The mains included the Entrecôte enrobed in a rich Béarnaise sauce, Lamb and Sweetbreads and the Hake perfectly cooked. All the entree were served with a mash potato and french green bean.

Les Trois Cochons,TBMside,"June 2, 2015",More than disappointed,"We booked this restaurant for our anniversary whilst staying for 4 nights in Copenhagen, what a mistake. We had read and understood ""the concept"" but were surprised to find the 3 shared starters were all cold pre-prepared offerings. We chose pork for the main course, this arrived and was obviously one large piece of pork seared on the outside and sliced into 4 very thick slices, placed on top of a dish of ratatouille, I took a piece of pork and was immediately concerned that it still looked very pink but the restaurant was so dark it was difficult to see it properly but when I tried to cut through it it was the texture of uncooked pork and was obviously seared on the outside and raw in the middle. We courteously called over a waiter and asked if he thought it was still pink and raw, he said he would ask the chef to look at it, he immediately came back and said ""the chef said it is cooked"". We apologised and said we couldn't eat it this way and could we have it cooked through please. After 10 minutes the dish was returned, this pork was sliced even thicker and it was exactly the same, the waiter had stood over us so again we asked for it to be cooked thoroughly all the way through, my husband suggested perhaps slicing it more thinly so that it would cook through. It was taken away and we were told as it was busy it would be 10 mins or so. We waited far longer than 10 Minutes and another waiter even brought plates and crockery for our dessert and we had to explain that we hadn't had our main course yet! Eventually the pork was returned, sliced into thinner pieces. It looked cooked but we then found that one side had been chargrilled so much it was blackened, I took a bite and was crunching through what resembled charcoal. I honestly believe this had been done deliberately as we had dared to disagree with the chef's proclamation that it was cooked in the first place. Appalling. To top it all during our long embarrassing wait we were brought a second bottle of tap water which we hadn't asked for and when we got the bill we had been charged for it. This was the only restaurant or cafe we visited over 5 days which charged for tap water! We were so upset by the whole debacle that we paid the bill in full and left. I have provided feedback via email to the restaurant but they have not had the courtesy to respond.",1

We knew concept (shared starter, desserts) before going - but didn't know that we also had to share the main, we opted for the steak, but again had to settle, as I like it rare and my wife is more of a medium gal. Also we couldn't eat one of the starters (tartare = raw mince) but we not given any alternative.

This is my only criticism, if any. The rest was a great pleasure. As a group we had to accept the set starter and dessert menu, but could choose between two main courses out of the selection on the menu card at the time of booking. The starter was a mix of different courses selected by the chef, with fois gras as an added choice. It all tasted good and we were glad there was some time between the starter and the main course. The selected confit de canard was excellent and more than we could eat, so all in all a very good experience. The place was completely full, so it is obvious that this is one of the restaurants to recommend!",4

Les Trois Cochons,mandagoosh,"September 9, 2014","Wonderful food, good location","The location of this restaurant is great. Tucked away on a smaller street (surrounded by other great restaurants). While the place is pricey, I really enjoyed the food and felt it was worth the price. We had a slight misunderstanding of the concept at first - 3 courses and the main course is served for two. In other words, if you have a table of 4 (as we did) then you can get 2 porks or 1 pork and 1 fish (as we did). In the end, it worked out great and the servers were very nice as we tried to understand each other. Each course was delicious. I loved the frog leg starter and the pork belly was so flavorful. Dessert selection was good - the raspberry sorbet was the best part of it, but I'm not a big fan of crème brulee. Overall, wonderful restaurant, great staff, good ambiance, in a great location. Will definitely keep it in mind for a return trip to Copenhagen.",5

Many other reviewers have commented on the menu style, and we ordered four mains. Overall, I would say that the food was excellent... not outstanding but close. While in town we also ate at a place in Dragor and had a catered dinner for work, and I thought the food here was slightly less good than those.

We were placed in the basement next to the toilets in a small cladosporium-smelling room with 3 tables put together making a personal atmosphere impossible for only 6 people. Used all napkins for drying sweat, the noisy fan put close to the tables didnt do any good except drying contact lenses. We were charged 120 DKK for water we had to constantly drink not to dehydrate and pass out. Mail course ok and desserts good.

Les Trois Cochons,MrC0920,"September 6, 2013",Tres Bien Les Trois Cochons,"This was a recommendation from from the Owner of a nearby Hotel - a kind of a local place - atmosphere was energetic, the restaurant was full. We thought the menu set up was interesting - the Main Course is a 2 person shared ""Main Course"" listing Starters, Main, Desserts menu. Main options are listed - they are shared - meat, or fish, or vegetables. Starters were a Beet/Radish salad In a glass container with a dressing/aioli/mayonnaise, a small plate of 4 Frog Legs, and a plate of Fig, shaved ham (like Prosciutto) with roasted Hazelnuts and a touch of goat cheese. Perfect portions for 2, great different favors, we enjoyed each - and each was a new flavor for us. We had The Cod, which was served in a pot with butter beans, celery, and some other vegetables that I can't name - but this was also very good. We then had a pot of coffee and then dessert was served - Creme Brûlée, a raspberry pastry, and chocolate ice cream with chopped hazelnuts. Again very good.

The place was empty when we arrived so I thought he must have been smoking something, 30 minutes later the place was full! The food was exceptional. The best meal we had on our entire trip. The menu was simple. Fish or Lamb, you don't like it leave. Ahhh the French. Gotta love that attitude. We stayed and ordered the lamb and some red wine. What a great decision that turned out to be. A truly wonderful meal. The staff were friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clear and well decorated. Would recommend to everyone. As we settled up a patron started kicking off about his bill. He was dutch (who are notoriously tight and ill mannered) so no surprises there. The waiter very calmly handled the ingrates complaint, when what the guy deserved was a smack in the mouth.

For the main we both chose the confit duck; this was served with prunes, a delicious buttery mash, red cabbage and a beautiful duck sauce. Dessert was served in the same way as the starters so three different dishes - creme brulee, cardamom ice-cream and a sort of cherry pie. On top of this we had the foie gras pate which was served with the starters - thoroughly recommended. Obviously a lot of food so we were strategic!

Ordinarily, French fare is not our first choice, and some of the menu items were dishes we would not have ordered. But the food was simply fantastic - we loved everything we were served.

Les Trois Cochons,CMcNabb,"May 26, 2012",This little piggy says weeeeeee...,"Eating at the three pigs is an experience that is rare outside towns in coastal southern Italy, where the chef is apt to tell you ""we have a very nice sea bass tonight."" Period. That's it. You order it, and out come all these wonderful small plates of vegetables and other fish --and a wonderful sea bass as well. It's like that at Les Trois Cochons: you get a small selection of what they have that night, and you get it served as you would at a friend's house, where no one complains that they haven't been given a menu. The thing is that because the menu is so limited, the quality of the food is much higher than it would be at most comparable restaurants, let alone establishments that have menus the length of your arm. And you can start with a pastis, which is always a good sign.",5

Les Trois Cochons,Aberdane,"February 13, 2012",Surprisingly good,"I have known of this restaurant for some time but hadn’t really heard about it lately so had mixed expectations. As we had been out for a stroll we ended on this fantastic street where we decided to opt for lunch and give this place a chance. We had a very simple lunch with us both ordering “Steak Frites” and a beer. We didn’t expect much as the prices (125 kroner for the Steak) is very similar to average café prices in Copenhagen. But but… the service was excellent, attentive but not imposing, the steak was tender and had a great taste of grill and it was accompanied by nice and crisp frites. A last plus is the fact that their draft beer is not the generic bland from a mega brewery but from a smaller (not totally micro) brewery. If in the neighbourhood I will definitely go again and although it was a very brief encounter I don’t hesitate with the generous four stars. (Five stars if the credit card machine had worked, their had been salt and pepper on the table and the menu had been just a bit bigger).",4
Les Trois Cochons,LeGourmand,"January 28, 2012",Top quality and good value...,"...is a combination you don't find that often, but Les Trois Cochons served it up. Stylish interior, filled with Copenhagen's pretty things, and on a very fashionable hip street. Its vitakl to book ahead, lots of people were getting turned away the Saturday we were there on a cold snowing January evening. There's no choice as such, you share everything they give you, but its worth trusting the chef, he's obviously a man who knows what he's doing. Three starters - brandade, marinated deer and gougeres, were all great, packed with flavour, and the cote de boeuf for mains was exceptional - it tasted like the meat had been hung for a good amount of time. Three further desserts to share, that I can't entirely remember (creme brulee, walnut ice cream?) and a reasonable bill to finish of around £80 which is cheap for Copenhagen, and we left absolutely replete. I only managed a single beer with the meal, due to the quantity of food. Charming waiting staff, and overall an excellent experience, very informal and a great alternative to the Michelin merry-go-round that Copenhagen is threatening to become..",5

It's very reasonably priced (250kr pp at the time of writing) and the quality is just amazing. Due to the lack of choice, it would be worth checking that what's on the menu for that day actually appeals to you, but whatever it is, rest assured it will be cooked to perfection! The building itself is a bit 'rustic' (i.e. falling apart in places, and the toliets in the basement aren't somewhere you'd want to spend much time), but the atmosphere is lovely and the quality of the food means you won't care at all about the decor.

So I Told them it was not according what I ordered. She agreeded with me. I did not want them to cook another one because I know that I am eating alone than while my husband was already finished. So no complain there but the least they could have done was offering a coffee or so. And mind you the place was rather expensive even for Kopenhagen. A pity",2

I had a hamburger with fries and my wife had the lamb, a couple soft drinks, two desserts and coffee and tea for about 700 kroner. My meat was tasty and almost too much to eat; the lamb was tender and delicious. The broiled cabbage was a unique way to serve an otherwise bland vegerable.

Peder Oxe is located in a large open square (we sat outside) in late September. Service was very slow - we didn't initially mind, although would have been nice to have been told that starters would take 30 minutes to arrive. That evening they did have a large group booking - and it looks like this restaurant is geared to look after large parties/bus load of tourists (not for those who would like a romantic or fun evening with a few friends). We had dinner (the mushrooms for starters and mains picked cod - bad choice as small and overcooked - dry and sad). Big disappointment as the food was neither tasty nor generous - definitely the lowest value for money (i.e. a rip-off) I have experienced in my 30 years travelling to Copenhagen. Wish I could be more positive but not recommended. (P.S.

I do want to mention the steak special I had with my prix fixe was not great.

Peder Oxe,Beguronline,"June 8, 2017",Not the same standard anymore !,"The last many years we have come for lunch here during our yearly visits to Copenhagen. According to tradition we also this time ordered the three open faced sandwiches for lunch but the quality of these seemed to have decreased. The rye bread was stone hard, the amount of 'pålæg' was less and the recipe for the chicken salat had changed and therefore not as tasty as previous. (It used to be delicious !) Even though the restaurant was not full service was slow and many tables were left in cleaned by staff. All in all an experience which get us to choose another lunch restaurant next year.",3
Peder Oxe,KristinaVerbeek,"June 7, 2017",Such a disappointment!,"Last Thursday we went there for lunch. Something we have done often as we used to live in Copenhagen and later whenever we came to visit. Usually we went for the 3 pieces of smørrebrød (open faced sandwiches). Also this time. These sandwiches used to be fantastic. Not so this time. The bread on which they came, was this time so hard that we had trouble cutting it. I didn't even eat any of the bread as I was afraid of breaking a tooth. Also the toppings had changed and not for the better. Do they have a new chef? Has someone else bought the place? We don't know. But, unless they go back to the original Peder Oxe, this was our last time to eat there. The only positive was the service with a smile. Such a pity. ",3
Peder Oxe,Tom B,"May 21, 2017","Great atmosphere, terrific staff, food terrific","We have eaten at the Peder Oxe before, but it has been a long time. One of our favorite memories of Copenhagen is eating here, and finding an excellent 'hamburger' (not with bread) accompanied by great service. On our return this week, we sought it out, made a reservation, and were once again pleasantly surprised by the staff and food. This time we had the Sole, with an extra side of the white asparagus. The sole was superb, just a little crusty, but moist and tender, with tiny potatoes perfectly cooked, and some wonderful cabbage (not normally one of our favorites). The asparagus was crunchy but flavorful, with a white sauce that was just the right touch. We finished off with the 'lemon pie', which was as good or better than any we have had. My wife and I split it, as the fish with sides was plenty of food, and it was just right, not too sweet, not too tart, and the crust was crunchy without being too heavy or thick. Our only regret is that we are only in Copenhagen for the one night and cannot return again tomorrow! Highly recommend it.",5

We had 2 different ones with herring - one was excellent and the other was just divine with dill & capers in a fantastic sauce. We also had one with plaice and one with beef which were also good.

I had these huge asparagus for a starter, and a melt in the mouth pork belly as a starter. My husband had lobster soup, and rabbit. Everything was absolutely delicious. The staff was so great that they would keep apologising for start speaking in Danish and not in English, even though we were on they're turf. Thoroughly enjoyable.",5
Peder Oxe,monad837,"April 30, 2017",As I remembered ,"I first went to Peder Oxe in 1985. At a time when the restaurant scene in Denmark was nothing spectacular, Peder Oxe stood out as the best meal on that trip. Fast forward 30+ years, I was surprised to find it still there with the same colorful menu cover. The food was still solid. The lobster soup was very good, but I live in New England so I expected more lobster meat that 1 measly spoonful. If you are from the Northeast US you'll be disappointed in the lack of lobster meat, but man, the flavor is all there. I also ordered the sirloin. It was standard fair and cooked to order. I came here for nostalgia reasons but now that Copenhagen has nouveau Danish cuisine I might try some place else next time. ",3

However, after my latest visit, this evening, I have to say that we were very disappointed with the food served. We ordered oxe burgers which tasted highly salted and processed - not a natural taste. And to add to this the accompanying sauce - some sort of crime fraiche pepper sauce - tasted acrid as if it had been burnt at some stage in the making. This was all served with a baked potato with Persia butter sauce which was probably the worst baked potato I've ever eaten, tasting like the butter bit had been made up from powder. The waiter tried to explain this away claiming it was a 'provencal' recipe!!! Not likely I think. I would like to have been able to post a positive review, as I often recommend this restaurant to people I know visiting Copenhagen.",2

The food came to the table with under cooked and under temperature vegetables. The lamb shank was well cooked, the venison was good and both were let down by the accompanying sauces and vegetables. I think the other reviews are right, it is a nice Danish place with an old fashioned charm but you'll get far more bang for your buck elsewhere in terms of both food and a dining experience.",3
Peder Oxe,HeliBell,"January 1, 2017","Unaffected, excellent cooking and a friendly environment","This isn't a modish sort of place but that's a huge factor in its charm. This was by far our best meal in Copenhagen; a slightly old-school mix of French and Danish cooking that used great ingredients and was simply delicious. The restaurant itself is housed in one of the older properties just off the main shopping drag, with an appealing tiled interior and vast open chimney breast with a very efficient log fire propped in one corner. Service was friendly and efficient and it was was easy to get attention. It's not an enormous menu but we had no problem finding something everyone liked, including kids. We had venison and sirloin steaks with (variously), chestnuts, crushed potatoes with Gruyere, spinach, parsnips and jus. Profiteroles and parfait for puddings. Regret not being hungry enough for the starters which included delicious-looking soups. Other diners didn't impinge.

The restaurant is excellently located, very close to the Stroget and in a picturesque, fascinating square. The place has a really good vibe to it, because the warmth of the traditional furniture (the wood, the chimney) ties in well with a nice, young clientele. I began with a Dover Sole, prepared à la meunière and served with a sauté of fresh spinach, tomato, capers and onion, with pumpkin purée and small potatoes. My friend opted for the braised lamb shanks, served on a bed of sweet onion and apple, accompanied by yellow beets, crushed potatoes stirred with Danish Vesterhavsost cheese and a lamb demi-glace. Simply delicious! We then shared the slection of five Danish and foreign cheeses served with chutney, organic bread and churned butter. The cheese was just the perfect way to finish off our meal. With a total of three bottles of beer - that was a local beer specially crafted for the occasion by a local brewer, and I cannot really remember its name - and one cup of coffee, the bill was about 715 Kr. ALTOGETHER. Great taste with prices in line with the average Copenhagen restaurant, while the staff was very kind and hospitable throughout.

Then when we had all sat down, a really officious waitress came over with a Danish flag, which she put in front of him, and said 'Happy Birthday'. Then she explained that we could only have the cake brought out if we paid a full price for a dessert each.

Each table has a lamp above with a button that turns on a green light indicating a need for service. Not really needed at all as the wait staff was quite available throughout, but fun. I ordered the fried herring starter which was a non-traditional but tasty dish followed by lamb shanks which were a surprising preparation of braised lamb removed from the bone and pressed into a little cake. All in all quite delicious but nt as hardy as one might expect. The only disappointment occurred when the main courses arrived before we were urged to take our salad at the salad bar which is included with each of the main dishes. Not having been to the restaurant previously we needed the advice to do that. Never-the-less, we did not leave hungry. Most of us did order the hazelnut ice cream for dessert and were disappointed when it was hard to find the ice cream on the plate as the portions were so small.

No it's not trad Danish fare and it's not the best food you'll ever eat. But all the staff were outstandingly welcoming. We has a drink in the cellar bar and it was atmospheric and fun. The maitre D found us a table and we had a great meal. I wouldn't bother with the salad bar, a bit Pizza Hut on a bad day. But the chips are superb and my hamburger was way more than the usual in terms of flavour. Ditto my partner's steak. The decor is quirky and the atmosphere buzzing. A restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously but recruits the best serving staff by a mile we encountered in the city. And the rose at the bar next door is really good (and cold) too.

It comes with a VERY generous dollop of cream so if you don't want so much, you should either tell them or dish it out before stirring it into the soup. I also had the venison steak, slightly tough and had a slight smokey gamey taste - I expected that given it's red deer.

Our beef was done to perfection; the baked potato was the best I have ever had; the vegetables fresh and crisp; and the sauces for both the potato an beef were fabulous. We had a beer before dinner and sampled the cask wine with dinner because we have never seen this offered before. A mild wine but fine with all of the wonderful tastes of the meal.

I chose steak, which was flavourless and a little tough, with dull cabbage and a small pot of dauphinoise potatoes. My wife chose wild boar which was just OK. We shared a dessert tapas which was good in parts - an excellent chocolate fondant, but so-so cheesecake. The bill with wine was DKK 900 for two.

All this in a rather officious tone, which didn't bode well, especially when we we subsequently told that not enough of us had ordered the menu so we couldn't have it after all. However, when we arrived all of this was set to one side as the waitress could not have been more friendly and helpful. The food was good (particularly the ""deer"" ) but expensive, although not too out of line with other Copenhagen restaurants.

We complained during dinner and after and she informed the butler/chef (at least she said). The problem startet with the butler not excusing nor admitting poor quality.

Peder Oxe,VanTourist_99,"April 6, 2013",For famous sandwiches do not come here,"Not bad for location but really poor value overall, at least for the smoerrebroed! You can surely do much better elsewhere and staff seem really uptight ",2
Peder Oxe,Ugurd,"April 3, 2013",Old favourite,"This was my third visit but it had been 25 yrs since the last time. The place had not changed I was glad to notice. Excellent service, great dishes and good wine. The rooms are rather spacious with white cloth on the tables without being too fancy. We had sole which was perfect as we were not that hungry. It was accompanied by capers, walnuts, croutons,fresh parsley and butter-roasted potatoes. We finished with Irish coffee which was prepared at the table which was a first for me.",5
Peder Oxe,Jon Olav S,"March 6, 2013",A bit pricey - but value for money,"I recently had dinner at Peder Oxe at Gråbrødretorg in Copenhagen. The staff was very friendly, the food was good - and two nice touches: When the meal was served, I was told you could ask for more sauce and popatoes if necessary. And the wine of the house comes in a bottle that shows how much you have consumated - and this is what you pay for.",5
Peder Oxe,razumny,"February 21, 2013",Still a perfect lunch,"Peder Oxe is a beautiful place, with a huge, hearth-style fireplace, which has a fire all through winter. Get three of their sandwiches, a nice beer to go with it and you're set!",5
Peder Oxe,mddicks0n,"February 21, 2013",Excellent,"We selected this place from a couple of guide books - it was February, Monday and about 7 p.m. but they sat 7 of us straight away. It is a lovely environment - interesting and attractive and the service was fantastic. Accomplished and friendly from very well presented staff - the menu is not wide in its range but the food was very good. The steak was never going to leave me struggling to finish but it was cooked as requested and came in a delightful tarragon and wine sauce that was delicious. The profiteroles were special and the beer sensibly priced for Copenhagen. Decent ambience and would recommend without hesitation.",4
Peder Oxe,Aatraveller03102011,"February 2, 2013",Little Danish gem,What a brilliant place. Classic and slightly modern Danish food. There are some French dishes which gives additional you continental options. The staff are not only friendly but very informed especially if you needed directions or suggestions. Service is relaxed and of high standards. Would take family and friends there. Also the bar in the basement is really cosy on the evenings. Peder Oxe is a great stop for lunch and dinner.

Peder Oxe,friendlytrips,"January 28, 2013",Beautiful!,"I went here on a recommendation from a friend. I have passed by this place a million times but never gone in. This time I did and I was pleasantly surprised. The place is exceptional, the decor is minimal but the restaurant is very warm and welcoming. The service was great. Not hurried at all. The waitress was very professional, but still had a very personal touch. But with all restaurants in Copenhagen of this statue, lunch is not cheap. I had the special three sandwich, you choose what you like from a menu of about 20 and the cost for that is DKK149.00 include a beer and perhaps a snaps and the bill is well over DKK200.00. But worth every penny, eh sorry every krone! Some of the other restaurant that I have reviewed in Copenhagen does give you more herring. But here I did not miss the extra amount of food. However I would like to add that of the restaurants that I have reviewed in Copenhagen for Lunch I have not found one that is ""outstanding"". Every restaurant I have been to is excellent, one that Tripadvisor does not list is Gammel Mønt (I have requested a listing) but that restaurant comes close to excellent. It is also located in the inner city.",4

Peder Oxe,traveldish,"January 20, 2013",Perfect spot to wind down and enjoy fabulous food,I can't say enough about this amazing restaurant. I enjoyed a late lunch here. Chose two open faced sandwiches ( very Danish) and the salad bar for 159. Danish krona. I chose smoked salmon and a pork sandwich which came with the best tasting beets. Each of the two course sandwiches was a meal on its own. On top of that I had the salad bar which was the best I have ever had. With. Glass of wine I spent $40.00 Canadian dollars but was excellent value for the quality and quantity of food. The staff was excellent as well. Will go back next time I am there. ,5

Peder Oxe,Rhi3,"January 19, 2013",Excellent food and surprisingly good value,"Although the menu at Peder Oxe is not all that extensive, there are some distinctive dishes and the quality of the food is excellent. My partner and I enjoyed lobster bisque, steak, zander and the ""dessert tapas"". Service was friendly and efficient, helped no doubt by the ""green light"" system. Interestingly, we found that a special occasion three course meal with aperitifs, wine and coffee at Peder Oxe seemed to be better value for money than some much simpler meals that we had elsewhere in this very expensive city, during our short stay. Definitely recommended.",5

It is very popular and in particular on our New Year’s Eve visit. We had done our homework and reserved a table. The atmosphere is very appealing, the waitresses (only young Scandinavian blondes) were attentive (although quite weary after a long day on the job) and the food was delicious. The appetizing lobster came with three different dip sauces and the deer with trufle sauce was incredibly tender and savoury.

Peder Oxe,climate_criminal,"December 20, 2012",Lovely restaurant,"Had a delicious meal at this central Copenhagen restaurant. Very good food, excellent service, and very attractive decor.

Peder Oxe,Bjorn65,"December 3, 2012",Disappointing,"We had pre-booked a table for 10 as it was a busy season for December dining. Service was friendly, but the restaurant was chaotic, and our table was placed in the middle of a human traffic junction. Additionally every time the front door opened we had a gush of centi grades below zero down our spines. Some of the dishes were good, but not all of them. Those who ordered the duck got it on the table almost before ordering it, so it must have been cooked hours earlier. It was though and dry. The sole was tasty enough. At the end of the meal it was clear they wantet us to leave in order to get another seating for the night, and we were offered a glace of wine downstairs as a compensation. We were all in a good mood, but the whole place was overcrowded, so we left.",2

Peder Oxe,Clodagh B,"November 1, 2012",You have to go there!!!!,Walked in on a cold blustery night- got a warm greeting from the friendly staff wearing a traditional costume uniform. Restaurant was busy for mon and tues nights- yes we went there two nights in a row!!! There is a lovely wood burning fire at the back corner of the restaurant. The menu is small but perfectly formed. We shared carpaccio to start which came with a basket of beautiful bread- followed by another!!! Then I had the beef steak and my husband had the duck. Both were excellent. For our second night we both had the burger and agree it was the best burger either of us ever had. We drank the very lovely house wine and thoroughly enjoyed both nights. Would strongly recommend it. The restaurant is set in a beautiful little square full of restaurants but don't go any further than this one!!!!,5

Peder Oxe,Tmellem,"September 29, 2012",Too crowded!,"Went to Peder Oxe for what we were hoping to be a romantic dinner for two. Even though we had reserved a table 24 hrs in advance, we were seated at a table just next to the staircase and toilets. The poor waitress did her best to relocate us to a better table - to no avail. Ended up leaving the restaurant after the main course. Could not stand having hundreds of people rushing past us for fetching food or running to the toilets. Will never return unless we are guaranteed a table at the ground floor. The food were decent, though. A hint to Peder Oxe; reduce the number of tables or at least rearrange to even out the HUGE quality differences between the different tables. ",2
Peder Oxe,murphpop,"September 28, 2012",Definitely one to visit in Copenhagen,"We had a very nice evening meal at this restaurant after a day of sightseeing in the city. We hadn't booked and were given a side room with only two tables which was perfect for us as we were quite tired and didn't want the noise of a busy restaurant. Two of us chose main courses with the unlimited visits to the salad bar and we were impressed with the variety of salad. The other two had bread and butter which was freshly cooked. For main courses we had wild duck, beautifully presented with autumn fruits and nuts; a delicious stuffed lamb and a very good burger with a Dijon sauce. There were two excellent things about the restaurant. The light/button that you could press when you wanted to order or request something - it took the waitress less than 10secs to respond each time. It was also possible to get the house red (a very easy drinking wine) in a graduated bottle so you only paid for what you drank which was perfect for us as two of us did not want to drink. There was no pressure on the others to finish the bottle and of course had they wanted to, they could have had part of a second bottle. Staff were very helpful and the food was cooked to individual tastes - a very nice place for dinner.",5
Peder Oxe,unclepious,"September 17, 2012",Danish Charm,"It's an attractive restaurant with an appealing wooden 'Olde Worlde' interior and small rooms and alcoves. A bit like a utilitarian version of Rules in London. We went as a large group (20+) booked earlier in the day and we were to their credit accomodated without too much fuss. The food was good rather than spectacular-lobster bisque and steak, served competently by waitresses who gave every impression of being slightly inconvenienced by our presence but were too polite to say so. That said, everything was fine really. Come here for what is widely regarded as consistent quality and good service, but the food is unlikely to set your heart going thumpety thumpety thump, unless someone else picks up the bill that is.",4
Peder Oxe,Karen R,"September 16, 2012","Great food, but service could improve.","Peder Oxe has always been a popular place for Danes to go and enjoy a good meal on the Gråbrødre square or the cozy interior with the fireplace and tile-decorated main hall. The selection of dishes is great and the quality persistent. However, there is too much hassle in getting drinks from the bar dowstairs and sorting the payment out.

The first night we ate outside, and my husband and I both ordered langoustine after seeing it being served. It was as good as it looked. We started with a delicious chanterelle appetizer served on toasted Danish bread. Also, we enjoyed a typical Danish dessert that is a kind of fruit compote served with cream -- excellent. Next to us a group of Swedes were served whole Dover Sole that looked great. So we returned the next night and had the sole: perfectly prepared, and served with pureed peas on the side. We had the same dessert, and my husband had the chanterelles again while I had the buffet salad. The salad was fine, but the chanterelles were probably a better choice (or maybe the lobster bisque that we didn't try). We drank local beer on tap. We thought this place was a real find and is located on a lovely square (or oval) with a number of other restaurants and a fountain in the middle.

We ordered hamburger with baked potatoe - didn't sound great but let me tell you, it was absolutely the best hamburger and baked potatoe I've ever had. The meat was cooked perfectly, medium still pink inside and crunchy on the outside. The potatoe, OMG, I even asked if they had taken out the inside, whipped it and put it back in the potatoe skin, no they hadn't. When you are ready to order, need a refill or want anything, you push a button above your table and a light lights up and your waitress comes immediatelly.

The real problem was the service -- the place uses a system of turning on a light to get a server's attention. We did so, and it still took a long time to get help. Half of our food didn't come out, and we had to ask a couple of times for this to be resolved (the first person we spoke to said ""I'll look into it"" and then went to stand in the same place in the dining room she'd been standing before, taking no action).

We enjoyed the beef tartar, herring, chicken salad, roast beef, and especially the Ris Alamande dessert. (Rice pudding with cherries on top). Yum.

Anyways, the food was good, but it was not anything to write home about. For the price you pay, I definitely expected a higher standard for many things.

There was a three course set menu option, which sounded delicious, a selection of smørrebrod (which looked delicious), but we went for the half lobster with salad, accompanied by a bottle of white Burgundy, and it was all wonderful.

We each selected a 3 course meal (could have had 4 or 5 courses) paired with ample wine pours that brought out the complexity of the food and showcased the wine! Oliver's considerable wine knowledge shined as we quizzed him! Several hours later we departed, contented, with a list of other restaurants for our week-long visit and ""real Copenhagen"" sites to see (not the usual tourist locations) courtesy of Oliver! This dining experience exceeded our expectations in style, presentation, complexity of layered tastes, wine pairing and service! At an adjacent table, a family with 12 and 18 year old children, enjoyed appetizers and entrees... something for everyone!

After looking at the menus we ordered (and eventually enjoyed) a mix of coffees, wine/beers, cakes, juices, and ice creams - not surprising choices for a mid afternoon snack. But it created confusion and a bit of consternation for our server who had to do separate items on different bills. Not that she was in any way unpleasant...it's just that for unknown reasons having one person pay for all of this across two tables seriously upset their 'system'.",4

We were eventually seated at an outside table. The restaurant has a picturesque setting in the parks by Rosenburg castle and the conservatory is beautiful. We were promptly offered drinks and decided to order 2 open sandwiches each and anticipated having cheese later. Having ordered, we waited around 20 minutes for two smallish plates to arrive and the food was superb, with well balanced flavours. (We mentioned to each other that we expected all the sandwiches to arrive at the same time). We waited and waited and waited for the second of our courses to arrive. For 40 minutes we were once again ignored by all of the staff, no one offered an apology or a reason nor did anyone offer us anymore drinks. After trying to make eye contact and ask after the food for 15 minutes we decided to cancel our order. The staff were rude, did not communicate with each other and offered no apology as to why the service had been slow or a discount on the bill. The restaurant was not particularly busy and the staff didn't see that way either - lazy! I was hugely disappointed. The staff and service ruin what could be a lovely restaurant with great food. ",1

Orangeriet,Stibinho,"May 12, 2013",Excellent atmosphere and tasty food,"The Orangeriet restaurant is located in a really nice house in the ""Kongens Have"" park and also offers outside seating. We really liked the atmosphere (lovely pastel colors and nice light). The menu offers mainly Danish dishes with a good choice. As a starter, the lobster was excellent. Main dishes (entrecote and lamb terrine) were tasty, however the side dishes were too small. I can also recommend the desserts (we chose a yoghurt dessert with ice cream). The service was excellent and our waitress explained all the dishes. However on our final bill several items were missing so it had to be corrected twice. Value for money is average (good food but slightly too pricy), but I would still recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner with an outstanding atmosphere.",4
Orangeriet,Daniel M,"April 23, 2013","Good food, lovely surroundings","Had an excellent meal at this very nice restaurant. It is slightly beyond the main tourist centre, but definitely worth the walk. As the name suggests the restaurant is in an old Orangery that was part of a stately home, and the large windows give an airy feel and nice views of the adjoining park. The food has a very Scandinavian feel, with twists on traditional favourites and a strong emphasis on fish and seafood, which was very well prepared. Service was excellent, we hadn't booked and were told we would have to wait for our food a bit longer, but the wait didn't seem long at all to us. Definitely recommended. ",5

For the salmon starter we had a too sweet white wine, for the main (duck) a too fruity and light red and the dessertwine for the tarte tatin was so mild and light, you couldn't taste it for the flavours of the sweet. The atmosphere is nice, and as I said, nothing wrong with the food, but I wished they'd chosen other wines and if I go on my own, I'd definitely oick my wine myself, rather than leaving it up to the staff....",3

We were a larger group and service was friendly, knowledgable and attentive. Both the quality of the food and the serving sizes of the dishes were good. Must highlight the lemon pie desert option which all of us thought was excellent. Another group of 8 guests showed up 30 minutes later and were seated right next to us (behind us) even though there was plenty of room on the other side of the restaurant. There was so little space between the tables that the waiters had to constantly squeeze through - poor seating planning and therefore my rating goes a notch down from excellent to very good (4 stars).",4

The food we ate was quite good, and the wine we had was good, be it that the white wine was too warm to my taste. Since we were a large group we got a fixed menu. The starter was nice. The main dish was a big piece of meat with two minor pieces of beet(?), and slightly disappointing. The desert was fine again, and they did not have decaf coffee. Strange enough, the vegetarians were asked to sit together at one part of the table. Happily they did not ask us to further separate us.

The location is indeed great, but it was too windy today to sit outside. The food was excellent and the presentation beautiful, but the service was nothing to write home about. The only person who smiled was the woman who asked us if we wanted a ""snaps"" with our beer. This we declined, since it was the middle of the day, and not only that, we were on bikes. Maybe they had us pegged for stingy Swedes after that? We ordered two open faced sandwiches each. The first two arrived promptly enough, and very good they were. But after waiting, and waiting some more, watching other guests get served, eat their food, pay and leave, we finally stopped a waitress and asked what happened to our other sandwiches. She promised to check. We waited some more, and then they finally arrived. Beautiful and very tasty this time as well, but why the wait? We have been to other restaurants who serve the famous Danish sandwiches, where the next one arrives the moment you finish the first - so what happened here? Maybe a mishap. The restaurant was less than half full. A smile and a ""sorry about the delay"" would have helped a great deal. We did not leave a tip.",3

It feels like you are on the sun porch of someone's summer house rather than in a restaurant in the center of a city. Service was excellent - very friendly staff who are willing to recommend courses and/or wine to you. We started with two appetizers (salmon and scallops).

We could barely eat a few mouthfuls before we put oput knife and fork together and stopped eating. The serving staff ignored us for the next 15 minutes before we eventually called them over to clear the table. They never bothered to ask us why we hadn't eaten the food!

They had for instance La Tache from Romanee Conti 2008 (9500 DKR) which should be stored at least 10 years.

We had to wait at the door about 5 minutes but this was understandable for how busy there were. The place has a loud lively vibe, playing good music with a live DJ on the Friday night we were there, which we really enjoyed, if you want a quiet place there are plenty others to choose from, but if you're in the mood for a fun night out this is the place. The cocktails were really good, made with some very good ingredients and you could tell some were home made ingredients which is always a sign of a good bar. Presented well they went down very quickly and we were recommended a very good white wine by the waiter. He was also very helpful in describing the menu to us and every selection was delicious. The crispy rolls with the thai salad was my favourite, I was shocked to discover I'd never tried real thai mint before as well as a different sort of tarragon and some lettuces.

We had the best young waitress who spoke fluid English and explained everything. They have a very lively specialty drink menu and the bartender would ask what we normally like to drink and made suggestions based on our tastes. My husband and I ordered the crispy pork & crab rolls. It came with a side of greens and herbs. They were amazing. My husband order a pork soup with wontons and I ordered a papaya salad. Both were very good. I would have liked to have tried other items but we were plenty full by then. This place is very upscale (and pricey)and was very busy.

She returned with one Saran-wrapped package, plopped it onto the table and said that was the best she could do. Really? She couldn't wrap each dish separately? It was bad enough that each dish had a salad accompanying a meat (duck and short rib, respectively). Both meat and salad were very flavorful with a mix of fresh herbs and spices.

It seemed like all the waiter wanted was to go home (we arrived at 9), he rolled his eyes every time we talked to him, and he threw the bill on the table before we asked for it. Then, just after we paid the bill (about an hour after we arrived), another waiter came and asked us to switch tables because he had some guests waiting for that specific table (even though half the restaurant was empty at this time).

We decided to order the 3 or 4 course menu as I found our waiter was not the most helpful. The food was wonderful albeit expensive. I have been to Vietnam several times and I would say this is equally as good. My biggest complaint was our waiter and the fact he either did not understand English (I doubt that) or quite frankly didn't care. He became very nice and attentive when I asked about tipping in Denmark. It is expensive but it is very good and I found everything in Copenhagen pricey. I think dinner cost about $200.00 for two including two glasses of wine. Portions were not huge but I was happy with them.,4

We had a cosy table by the window, not a lot of room for manoeuvre, it felt a bit squashed in to be honest. It was our first time in a Vietnamese restaurant and we asked advice on the menu, which was wasted on our server who just reproducing and saying yes that would be fine, yes this will be fine but not actually suggesting anything! We chose two starters between 3 which were nice - then 3 dishes for the main but these were disappointingly small which after finishing we ordered another as we still hungry!

The items on the menu all sounded delicious and many were from very familiar ingredients just with different spices and cooking methods so you don't have to worry about being too adventurous. Starter was Saigonese papaya salad with beef & Vietnamese coriander but as we were vegetarian they were very happy to leave out the beef and told us it would have no fish sauce as well (which we hadn't even thought about). It was the tastiest thing I have eaten in years!! Our main course was also wonderful (Vegetarian curry with coconut & different kinds of vegetables. Served with Jasmine rice & herbs).

Restaurant LeLe,Ironing_Board,"January 9, 2015","Slow Service, Inferior Food","I'm a novice with Vietnamese food, so I may have missed something, but both the food and the service left a lot to be desired. It didn't bode well when the drinks took 10-15 minutes to arrive at the bar for some of our party. Then we sat down - 10 of us - and it took 3 hours to get through our meal, with maybe 5 or 6 courses in all - so that is one course every 30 minutes. The quality was variable - between okay and, frankly, inedible. I refer to the stunning (and not in a good way) ice-cream dessert which smelt like rotten eggs crossed with cigarette smoke. Only one of us (not me) ate this, the rest either took a taste (the waiter said it tasted better than it smelled) or simply put the plate back over the dish and waited for the kitchen to count the returns. The octopus, spring rolls, sticky rice and pork were all okay - but no better than take-away standard. The food was described to us - although the waiter forgot the names of one or two of the dishes. We can forgive that. But hard to forgive slow service of mediocre food (we were the only people in the restaurant by 10pm) and the final insult of the bush-tucker trial dessert. We may have eaten it if it earned us something more edible. But that was an unlikely outcome here. So we left, retrieved our own coats (nobody around to do that for us) and waited outside in the cold for the taxi they had ordered for us.",2

Everything blended and the highlights of this meal were augmented by coconut crispy rice that was served with the salad. My travel companion opted for PhoBo a soup with noodles, beef and fresh vegetables that the server topped with a flavourful broth. We opted for Sannio, Falanghina, Taburni Domus, a dry white wine to compliment these menu selections, so good we said yes to a repeat. This meal was light enough to leave room to share a dessert: LeLe IsCheesecake, a texture new to us, topped with bananas and laced with ginger, peanuts and salted caramel; it was the sesame layer at the bottom that completed this dessert with a spoonful of delight.

It was very dry and quite odd, heavily flavoured with cinnamon - not Vietnamese at all. I had the pho which I wanted as a main. It was truly awful. Almost flavourless but with a vile aftertaste I don't know how they managed it. The wait staff were clearly unfamiliar with Vietnamese food. They put more effort into 'trendy' flourishes like pouring the Pho into my bowl from a teapot than they put into getting the flavours right. The beef was tough and tasted really bad. And there were blobs of bone marrow floating about which added nothing. Vietnamese food is all about fresh ingredients and a balance of flavours. In this the restaurant failed miserably. My husband (who is Vietnamese) ordered the caramelized pork. It was topped with a hard boiled egg straight from the fridge. A small sign of how lazy this place was with their food. The Vietnamese coffee was made with espresso giving it a weird flavour. The sprigs of mint didn't add to the experience either. It was also very expensive.",1

Starters were fine, but the main course lacked taste. Definitely not authentice Vietnamese taste, so we were disappointed.

The food came rather quickly and was decent, nothing special though, however their drinks were nice and especially their homemade lemonade! Price wise a little over the top for the quality but definitely a place I would like to visit again.",4

Although the menu is limited (like most restaurants in this town), they really know what they're doing - and the meals are delicious. The atmosphere is really great. In a country not known for its service industry, the service at Le Le is exceptional. We're a UK/US household - friendly service is very important in our dining experience. Le Le has a fabulous multi-cultural team - and you can really tell the management invests in the staff, and ensures a great atmosphere in the restaurant. In the evenings, the place is very lively and bustling. One of the friendliest places in Copenhagen. Would recommend to both visitors to Denmark (after you've had your fill of the excellent Danish food here, of course), and residents.",5

Restaurant LeLe,CPHTraveltheworld,"September 7, 2013",Overall average experience,I have eaten at lele on many occasions over the years and I am also a frequent user of their take away locations. I remain a fan of their food and dishes but was disappointed on a recent restaurant visit. The menu has become very limited and the selection quite uninspiring considering how much the cuisine could potentially offer. Prices are relatively high for what you get. It's big business now and all about profits rather than offering something unique. The restaurant remains very popular. Although the food is average the atmosphere remains vibrant and above average.,3
Restaurant LeLe,Magnus_Travel,"August 31, 2013",Good restaurant with authentic Vietnamese food,"This restaurant brought back memories from our 3 week trip to Vietnam all these years ago.

I'd also go for the Vietnamese iced coffee w/ Cointreau combined with the chocolate cake to get the full French-Vietnamese experience (You must love coffee and chocolate for this however!!).

The meal worked out much cheaper than we had come to expect in Norway and as a lover of Vietnamese food we found this very good. There are quite a lot of these restaurants around Copenhagen and the one we went to, Leles Street Kitchen is in effect the restaurant at Hotel Alexandra. It has no English translations but they explained what each item on the menu was in English and very clearly. They give you a beeper and your drinks as you take your seat. Food was ready in about 5 minutes and the ingredients were very fresh and true to style. A small selection of wine and beer at reasonable prices made this a great meal. All up we spent 300 Danish Krone for two types of spring roll, chicken wings and a beef dish plus a large diet coke and a large can of Tiger beer.",4

Restaurant LeLe,589MichaelP,"April 16, 2013",Stylish,I experienced Le Le as a part of Copenhagen dining week where a number of restuarants offer a fixed menu at a reasonable price in order to entice a wider range of guests. A great idea but everybody participating in the scheme arrives at the same time and receives the same food which puts a strain on the waiting staff. The dishes were on the normal menu and were I imaging selected on the basis that they could be pre-prepared to the greatest extent to cope with a big influx of guests.

The very talkative and pushy (Romanian ?) waiter was unstoppable in his praise for all the good wine and food. He apparently ""loved"" every item - especially the most expensive ones - on the menu.

Restaurant LeLe,MichaelVestergaard82,"January 11, 2013",Average experience,"We were surprised to see how huge this restaurant is, and how popular it is. So our expectations were high. The food was good, no doubt - but way to expensive given the amount, the time for cooking such simple dishes and the ingredients. The service was friendly and good, but not too good smelling (sweat).

I assume it was therefore that the service was somewhat slow and unattentive. The starters, 3 different, was delicious, an absolute delight, the main courses more mediocre. The beef was very tough, and underseasoned, the fish overcooked and dry. The coconut rice is just foul, more like fiddle-faddle. It does not go well with any of the main courses, so it a mistake and should be left out. It is quite expensive to eat here, and for us, really only the starters was worth it.",4

The dishes were beautiful and there was a lot of variation. We particularly liked a spicy pepper sauce served with the starters. The dessert, an earl grey sorbet, was the only disappointment tastewise. The room is very big and crowded, therefore the noiselevel got quite high. The service was okay, but I expect more with a price-level of 500 DKK pr person - we had to wait a long time for drinks, and the waiters got restless when we were having desserts and started moving tables around in order to get the remaining costumers out.

The variety is very widen so you can find something for everyone. The buffet combines classic UK oriented brunch with vietnamese kitchen (spring rolls and much more). And finally the restaurant is rather big and has critical mass to have many options and lots of all. So you can find hot chocolate for the fruit, fresh cold smoked salmon and all. The price for the buffet is fixed but the coffee / tea and juice is not included. So a long brunch may be a bit more expensive than expected from the very beginning.",4

This is huge, with not a Vietnamese person to be seen, either in the dining area or the kitchens. The food is good, excellent variety, and the wait staff attentive.

Comments from the waiter was: The glasses will not be wiped off but air dried. It did not help getting new glasses - I prefer wine from a clean glass. The table felt very sticky and when the waiter came clean it just seemed to us that she was re-allocating the leftovers from the soya. There were out of the hot wet wipes that you get, for cleaning your hands, so these were also missed. We will not visit again, but will definitely choose the one situated in Rungsted Havn.

The restaurant is divided between two small circular buildings one mostly dealing with take-away order plus drinks and the other dining only. There is an outdoor seating area between the two. The shape of the restaurant building dictates purpose made furniture - very attractive but the tables (for 4 people) are tapered i.e. those sitting in the inner most part have noticeable less room. The booking confirmation contains a warning that it is likely that parties of 2 or 3 will have to share a table with others. There is not much room between the tables. There is a single toilet for the restaurant. Very popular and people were being turned away on a Tuesday evening so booking advisable. The online booking system is easy to use and works well. Tables have an allocated time of 2 hours which is normally adequate.,4

Ever been to an Argos in UK where you write the catalogue number on a chit of paper and hand in at the checkout - this is the same. Bizarre and totally awkward.

Rambla,AntonioI1098,"March 21, 2017",Never again!,"I have been in this place for dinner during a City break with my girlfriend. Really nice ambiance but food and Service a very let down. Starting from the waiter he looked a bit lost and he messed up our order. He brought to the table a dish we didn't order and forgot the squid that we actually ordered. I've asked for an Estrella Galicia beer then the waiter came back telling me wasn't available and he didn't even have a clue of what I was asking about. Then he left with a choice of just one beer. About food: We took five different tapas and they were not really impressing. One was a shrimp with pumpkin puree, seeds and tarragon. Taste was ok but a single shrimp for 70 crown. It's way too expensive for one shrimp. We ordered the rambla potato dish and I was really excited about it 'cause you expect a good dish, as it was the same name of the place... But it was just a bunch of skin on fries (frozen), with a sweet dust ( I suppose it was beetroot based) and an aioli dip. For 45 crown... Then we had a Salmon tatare with pomegranate. Well presented but the salmon lacked in seasoning and the dish ended up a dessert like dish. The potato croquette with hiberico was ok but still a lack of seasoning in the croquette. We had a squid tapas wich was ok. Squid tasted really fresh but it came with a ink squid mayo that was tasting nothing but normal mayo. Maybe this review may sound a bit fussy but I'm a Chef and I expected much more for the money they ask. We asked for the bill very unhappy and still hungry.",1

A table that was not even cleaned until we requested so. Then, another 15 minutes of trying to get the waiter's attention to order food. After that, the experience started getting a bit better though. The food came out relatively quickly and was of good quality and taste.

Rambla,Kevin B,"February 28, 2015",Rambla - Decent Tapas near CPH Airport,"I travel to Copenhagen monthly and was tired of heading into CPH as well as dining at the hotel (Crown Plaza). A 10 minute walk from the hotel brought me to a quant little place. I would describe it as semi industrial in it décor. Sort of IKEA-ish but there was enough charm sprinkled around to make it comfortable and relaxing. The service was prompt after I was seated. The waitress was very helpful as they did not have an English version of their menu. Not a problem. After all I am in Denmark why wouldn't the menu be in Danish. She suggested a nice Spanish red which I regret not remembering the name. Full bodied, woody and dry. I place myself completely in her hands. She suggested the pork, steak and shrimp. I am always very leery of getting any type of steak in Denmark because it is just not something done well there. Pork on the other hand is a different story. Danes know there way around a pig. Shrimp is usually a safe bet in any nation surrounded by water. Anyways, I was not disappointed. Steak and pork were tasty and flavorful. They were accompanied by some very nice dipping sauces. The shrimp was outstanding. Grilled just enough to provide a little char. This is the one I would recommend for sure. There are many options here so you can put together an interesting meal that is flavorful and a little different. I closed out with a nice 20 year old port. Remember - It's Tapas. Small portions give you a chance to taste different things. It is great if that is what you are looking for. Also - it is not cheap. Dinner is going to cost you 75 - 100 US Dollars. Having said that. I will return. Hopefully I can get that same waitress!!!",3

Our cocktails (aperol and ginger based) were deliciously made with care and we were encouraged to say if we would like them slightly more sweet or sour.

And our bar tender knew how to make very obscure drinks. And they were so delicious! I think I tried 3 or 4 on our first visit.

You can sit on the outdoor deck right next to the path by the lake ... but the view is nice from most of the inside tables too. The cooking is great (especially the 'specials' like crispy fried trout - Pla Lad Priek and Pla Tod Thakrai) although obviously toned down in spiciness for Western palates. The staff are courteous and efficient and prices are reasonable for Copenhagen - my only gripe is that they charged for a jug of tap water (this should be made illegal).,4

We started with some extremely tasty Lao Dark beer and ordered the set '100. Mild Menu' for 199 dkk. They were happy to let us swap some of the basics with other fixed menus and began with the hot, sour soup which was exactly what was needed that night.

I ordered the mix tandoori grill and last time got lamb chops, which now have been replaced by a cheap and dry shish kebab. 250 Dkr for three shrimps, two tiny lamb kebabs and 1/3 of a tasteless chicken breast is way overpriced. Plus charging 40 Dkr for tap water and no refill is outrageous. The service was terrible and very cold. Our plates were taken away without asking if we were finished.

Our server was a lovely Hungarian girl, who was quick to serve drinks and gave us just the right amount of time to peruse the menu. The menu is not extensive, but what is on there is good. I had the chicken tikka starter, if anything, this could have been a bit bigger. My husband had the shish kebab which was excellent and a decent portion. So the two seemed a little miss matched on portion size. The mains were chicken madras and lamb karahi, both good and both spicy. The slight shock came with the wine list which was expensive when you were pairing it with curry, it seemed an over extravagance. One bottle on there at 1500 kr! Again, the wine list is not large. I had a glass of house red and husband had a large beer and then a second large beer. The bill was around 780kr, which for Copenhagen seemed ok. Would we go back, yes definitely.",5

Rasoi - Indian Cuisine,Suresh R,"February 16, 2016",Dictatorial pushy,"We were 14 individuals who wanted to eat together and have some nice Sunday evening together at this place. One of us booked the place two days in advance, but on the day of appointment, we were contacted by the Rasoi people that we must agree to a fixed menu costing about 350 Kr per head, without drinks, and that we cannot just order what we want to eat. Of course we immediately rejected their dictatorial proposal. What a bad approach towards customer service. Terrible, terrible - Rasoi, you are permanently blocked out from our kitchen now....",1

Both were very tasty and the meat was really tender. I ordered wine by the glass, which they let me taste before they served it to make sure I liked it. I am Canadian and my expectations are very high when it comes to service. I can say their service is probably the most friendly service I have had in Copenhagen in the many years I have lived here. It is located in the Ørestads area, very close to the Bella Sky hotel, Bella Center and Fields shopping mall. Highly recommended!",5

Of course, don't forget about the Onion Bhaji -- they're wonderful!. Everything was spiced nicely (I like hot spicy food and this food was well balanced). The service was good and very friendly.

Being indian I am very familiar with how indian food should taste and Rasoi's dishes lack any true Indian flavour and are extremely bland and dry. We were forced to return one of our vegeterian dishes described as a dal as the lentils were cooked to death and it was impossible to swallow without feeling sick. I would avoid this restaurant, it's quite expensive too!",1

Definitely a place where we will come back to with just as high expectations.",4
Rasoi - Indian Cuisine,denmarlef,"September 27, 2014",Not a place for solo diners,"Ate here as it is one of very few restaurants in Oresund and I was on an overnight transit stop. Not a huge place (maybe 15 tables). I could only be accommodated at a bar by the window which was the thoroughfare for everyone so that was slightly uncomfortable. The onion bhaji was delicious, crispy and served with mint sauce and a nice little asian salad side. And I ordered the spicy shrimp which is unaccompanied so I had to order rice. So ended up with too much food. They used those tiny shrimps you see all over Denmark and I am not fond of them. I asked for tap water and was charged 30dk. So a meal that I could get in Toronto for about 8 bucks cost $45 in Copenhagen. Welcome to the land of the $10 hotdog - in fact I don't think there is anything in Denmark that costs less than $10 lol They should do away with any currency under 50DK",2
Rasoi - Indian Cuisine,Sham B,"August 19, 2014",Amateur and overpriced,"I ordered one of the 140kr chicken meals expecting the standard delicous flavourful indian meal and instead I got a small bowl with thickened chicken and vegi soup without any spice taste, tasted just water with sour (galengal?). I was really dissapointed. Could have atleast thickened it a bit. Luckily i had some mint sauce I dumped in for flavour. I ordered a roti for 35kr. When a roti is priced at a kebab level you think it is large or really good and made with roti flour, it was neither. They fail ",2

I have tried several dishes from their menu and they have all been very good. It is quite unusual that I have been at a restaurant three times within three months and that speaks for an excellent place! Only downside is that your clothes smell of food after being at the restaurant, but I can live with that :-)",5

Should have listened to ""Sunny P""","We went here because it was within easy walking distance of the Bella Sky hotel, where we were staying. We had some reservations after reading other TA reviews, but we thought we would give it a try as we were tired and didn't want to go into the city centre. On arrival the staff were very friendly, the place was busy and we felt quite encouraged. It took a VERY long time for our starter to arrive, and they seemed rather understaffed, but my starter (onion bhaji) was pretty nice with a tasty dressed salad, my partners chicken was rather dry and salty. Eventually the main courses arrived, and unfortunately they were more or less inedible. They both consisted of a few bits of meat floating around in big bowl of incredibly salty goo, that seemed to consist mostly of tomato ketchup. Despite the fact that we left most of our meal there was no sense of concern or disappointment from the staff, so we just paid up and left. We won't be making this mistake again. Next time we will (i) make the effort to get on the metro to the city centre and (ii) will trust our instinct after reading TA reviews.",1

A new entrant, Rasoi is a genuine competitor to Cave as Copenhagen's best Indian. Still, it has a little work to do to earn the top spot. Dishes are just a little on the sweet side, and portions, while generous, are a bit light on the featured meat type. Respectable wine list, but despite being visibly available in the outside bar, the Danish beers are inexplicably left off the menu. Nonetheless, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4

Bread and butter was delicious and the little free nibble with our glass of champagne was very tasty. The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked and combined. The wine pairing was also very well done. The only thing that wasn't my favorite was dessert. It was a little too sour and citric...but then the Cortado that I had was to die for. Best in the City!!

We loved the antipasti that included artichokes, smoked swordfish with tomatoes, crespelle filled with potatoes and other selections. The artichoke risotto was creamy and subtly flavored, the spaghetti was coated with just enough aglio e olio. The lone dessert offering of zabaglione was terrific. Service was very friendly and casual, the restaurant has a cozy upstairs that was filled when we left.

I had the 3 course and my husband had 5 but they brought me a small taster portion of his 2nd which was a nice touch. We had our 2 year old with us and I was worried he wouldn't last the full meal but the staff were great - brought him a kids chair and small bowl and generally made a fuss of him, and prioritised our pudding so we could get going. No changing table in the loo but plenty of room to do it on the counter top by the basin (with his feet in the sink I'm not complaining, just telling how it is and glad there was somewhere to do it full stop). There was another family there when we arrived and one of their kids was lying on the floor watching something on an iPhone so definitely a family friendly place.

From simple pasta in garlic and chilli, to deep fried sage leaves, it was all excellent across the board. It's a lovely small restaurant, and was pretty busy for a Monday. They also were great with out two year old and didn't seem to mind him sitting on the floor for the last 30mins. As I'm a bit of a fatty I had the 5 course menu and my wife 3, and they gave her a small portion of pasta for free so that we had 4 courses together. The 5 courses were well spread, and not huge so you were able to enjoy them all, and not feel stuffed halfway through. Couldn't recommend it more.

FAMO Metro,morl8tr,"February 1, 2014","Very good, just a few operational issues","We had a great dinner at FAMO Metro. They serve a single, fixed price menu, so everyone gets exactly the same meal. There is a wine menu, if you want it, or you can order your own bottle from their wine card. Some are available by the glass. Our dinner started out with a roar, three or four courses in quick succession, all fabulous. The first was a simple course of fresh pecorino and thinly sliced ham (not parma, but something tender and fabulous). A plate of marinated cod, strewn with a delicious relish, a dressed raw vegetable, some polenta with a lovely light bean mixture atop it. All pretty Wow. Then for the next course, a ravioli and a risotto. Both good, but here is where they seemed to begin to have some pacing issues. Where first four courses had come pretty quickly, maybe even too quickly, suddenly service slowed down at this point. Long waits between these courses, and the main, which was a fabulously tender veal dish. Then a long wait for dessert. I think they had a large party downstairs (lots of waiters and dishes going up and down), so maybe that threw them off their pacing, but it was a little odd how some dishes came rapid-fire and others came after long waits. They seem to need to synchronise dinners who arrive at different times. So the couple nearest us started much later than we did (maybe 45 minutes), but they ended the night almost caught up to us. In any case, this is quite a good restaurant, with a very nice wine list. The early courses were exceptional, and some of the others were also very good. I recommend it, but don't go on a night when you are on any kind of a schedule. From start to finish, I think we spent 3 hours or so eating dinner, maybe a little more. It's a small place, and seating is a little tight. Not a lot of privacy, and the waiters sometimes bumped my chair because it was pretty compact.

The food is truly authentic Italian, so simple and so full of flavor. The staff is very friendly and you really feel Italian hospitality.

I wasn't expecting much better than canned spaghetti-o's at Famo Metro (I almost begged off)--was I wrong! This would be a first rate restaurant in any large city on any continent--the food was absolutely amazing, breathtakingly inventive and good. Genuinely Italian yes but also with clever riffs on Italian classics that respected the original food but took it to new heights. Ravioli stuffed with braised radicchio in a light broth, cod perfectly cooked served in a spicy tomato sauce with cannilinni beans, delightful antipasti one after the other. They serve a limited menu, sort of a set meal (I was a guest and so didn't really see the bill or understand how the ordering worked but I did get to glance at a menu). Expensive--yes but really hardly more than most upscale restaurants in town. The owners have two other restaurants which friends say are equally good. I'm planning to go tomorrow with friends--and I just finished eating!",5

Could have been larger, but that's just me:) Main course was chicken breast and thighs, where the thighs were a la confit. Probably the best chicken dish I have ever had! And this one was not too small for me:) This was a very cold spring evening, so the restaurant wasn't very busy, but they still managed to create a good ambience and the service was perfect!

We were seated and had a charming waiter serve us explaining the open sandwiches. My husband had one with herring and I had one with asparagus and smoked salmon. Both were really delicious. I asked the waiter what a particular ride was and he didn't know the answer. A little while later he cam back with a map of the rides and information for me, telling me which ride it was and where the entrance was. We had a lovely meal there and on leaving the maitre'd asked us if we had enjoyed out meal and told us about the free concert at 5 pm just over from the restaurant.",5

We had a large selection of restaurants, ranging from street food to elegant eateries. We selected Fru Nimb as I wanted something lighter for lunch as we had big plans for our anniversary dinner later in the evening. The selection of sandwiches was limited but excellent as far as very different toppings. I chose the boiled egg, shrimp and aioli on delicious Danish dark bread. Just enough for my lighter fare. The wine pairing was great--a nice Chardonnay. Hubby chose the smoked salmon open sandwich--looked delicious and he confirmed that it was. Overall, a very special lunch, inside, away from the crowds. There is the option of outdoor seating but it was still slightly cool outside with a breeze and neither of us smoke, hence the inside seating selection. Service was superb. Highly recommended!",5

The appetizer was a big beef tartan with creamy mustard sauce (yummy), the main dish, a giant ""tartelelet"" with chicken and mushrooms, and for desert, we got a lovely old fashioned Danish apple cake.

She was just a few tables over, but sadly, we didn't know it until she had left. We were aware of a couple of well dressed men at the table adjacent to ours and thought they must be successful businessmen. In fact, they were her security staff.

Easy to get by public transport. 3. Kimchi was served while waited a long time for hotpot soup. This comforted customer and showed their dedication on serving foods fast. Cons:1. As a native Chinese i don’t see this is delicious. It’s understandable if it’s not authentic since this restaurant locates at a foreign country but it’s not acceptable that it’s not tatsy . Ex: hotpot soup is pale, it lacks of aroma which is the key point to make a good hotpot soup.I ordered the most spicy one. Also squash is not suitable for hotpot since some of them have little bit bitter taste while it’s well-cooked. Pumpkin I had was pale without much tatse as it should be slightly sweet and creamy. 2. Service. Nobody was greeting and showing the way to table. I went in said hi,the chef told me to wait and I was standing by the counter,staff working inside and noticed I was there but didn’t say hi or any greeting. And nobody showing me the table until 15mins later, the girl suggest me to have a seat. During this 15mins there were other staff coming to get beverages NOBODY REACT. However just after 2 mins I got seated, the same staff came to me and told this table was reserved.Didn’t you suggested me to seat here yourself two mins ago? Several mins later she realized something and I kept my seat. poorest service experienced in Copenhagen/ not enough napkins.

As most of Chinese dishes, hot pot also follows some regional variations, and therefore you can't expect the same tastes everywhere. I liked the hot pot here, even though I prefer the hotter Sichuan version. The place is wonderfully cosy and perfect for a cold winter day. The staff is nice and takes good care of your hot pot experience, assuming - rightly - it might be a person's first time. It is great to have this option here in Copenhagen n ",4

The food was good quality wise but I was not impressed by the service or the prices. The staff seemed a bit confused and it took long time to get to order. We had to remind them several times to bring out forks and glasses, as we were one person more than the table was prepared for (even though I had booked for three people). In general we got the impression that they were understaffed. The food was OK but the over all experience was not something corresponding to the price we paid. ",3

Best lunch of my life! Every course was perfect, and they were happy to accommodate my one food allergy (mushrooms & truffles). I've since been back every time I've been in Copenhagen, and it's always one of the highlights! Whether you are sitting at the table watching the kitchen, the bar, or the cozy back room behind the wine cellar, the service, wine, and food are outstanding.

I got three cold dishes (Beetroots, Celeriac with salted cod and Black kale with pork rillettes - my favorite) and four hot dishes (roasted pumpkins, grilled onions, brussel sprouts with kimchi and roasted beef with greens - and here again the last one was my favorite).

Open, attentive service from the entire staff—just a singularly lovely experience...and one that clearly stems from an admirable philosophy about terroir and care of the land: these folks, allies of Relae across the street, share a full farm: from rabbits to Asian veggies.

About the dinner: the two of us had the 7-courses menu plus a glass of cider each. We ended up spending a total of 100 euros, so 50 euros each, which is about 745 dkk in total. I think it's a fair price for the amazing vegetables that are served: properly ripe, great quality, locally grown in a local farm etc.. In order to like this restaurant you need to really love vegetables. Cause some of the dishes are just e.g. raw tomatos but like 6 varieties, or salad but like 6 types of greens etc.. Those are the dishes where you can tell what wonderful raw materials they use.

Manfreds,J830LMjohnm,"July 2, 2019",Certainly different. ,Lots of different experiences in terms of food and wine options. Differentiated  presentation of food. Service was a bit lacking even though we had a late lunch. Pricey for what you get but worth a visit and a credit for its interest in organic.,3
Manfreds,Liz C,"June 26, 2019",Unique,Manfreds is an interesting restaurant using local produce and items from their own farms as the main ingredients. The menu changes fairly often based on availability and the dinner is served as shared plates. Very fun! You get a taste of such fresh ingredients! Loved it. (Reservations recommended) It's quite small.,5
Manfreds,ivymay13,"June 24, 2019",Fantastic vegetarian meal,We did the chefs choice here for lunch and it was delicious. Our favorite the salad and the cucumber.  The veggies are so fresh and the sauces so unique.  It’s also located on a super cute street with shops and other restaurants.,5
Manfreds,fioredisale,"June 18, 2019",Baseless Pretension,"Manfred’s was unquestionably the most disappointing meal I have ever had in my life. I have never experienced such gall in the preparation of food. The first course was an assortment of raw radishes placed on top of a liquidy hummus with some sourdough bread from their bakery. Sure this was fine but I was excited for what was to come. Possibly a more creative fare of vegetables with unique preparations to inspire. Little did I know that this fantasy of mine was eons away from the reality to come. The next courses seemed to be a game for the chef, toying with the imagination of the diner longing for any semblance of creativity. The food followed a grotesquely generic formula of [insert raw vegetable]+[insert bland dressing]. I was unaware of any lobotomy procedure the chef had, but save for this being a comedic practice of exploiting unaware diners with overpriced vegetables from a standard grocery aisle, this is my only reasoning for how the food could have been prepared in such a terribly uninteresting way. We made it through 5 of the 7 levels of food purgatory before the table decided we had enough of this cruel game of waiting for another atrocity to be placed in front of us. On a side note, it was taking at least a half hour in between the fifth and sixth course and the table was a powder keg ready to explode with anger over the baseless pretension of a chef cutting a zucchini in half, undercooking it and serving it on a plate with no care. I’ve had better tasting and better plated vegetables at a backyard barbecue. We paid the bill and left dissatisfied, hungry and angry. Do not eat here if you love food. Do not eat here if you love vegetables. I left Manfred’s wondering how such high expectations could be so comically distorted.",1
Manfreds,familyguy13,"June 18, 2019",Not good,"I came here expecting a meal that would show off Copenhagen’s notable reputation for using fresh ingredients in new and innovative ways. What I got was course after course of the same bland tasting food. I know what zucchini, bok choy, lettuce and radishes taste like. If I wanted those veggies served whole on my plate with very little seasoning, I could have gone to the store, bought them and thrown them on a plate myself. I was expecting something a little different. The food was uninspired. The one meat dish of pork was served cold. Service was indifferent at best. This was maybe the worst meal I’ve had in a restaurant anywhere in the world, and the owners should rethink what they are trying to do. I’ve never had such a gap between expectations and reality, and I regret wasting a night on my life at this place.",1

Manfreds,Callum M,"May 14, 2019",Shockingly bad value,"Recommended by numerous publications and our accommodation we took the plunge. I have rarely left a restaurant so dissatisfied and unhappy. The food was largely seasoned cabbage and assorted leaves - the bread was burnt, the poached eggs and pork at the end were a welcome rebate from the relentless onslaught of green drudgery. The shrimp were so small as to be inedible, and for the whole thing to be priced at 370DKK per person with the bulk of the dishes being shared is a slap in the face. Far too stylish for its own good, and evidently with a highly skilled marketing team who have managed to spin cheap vegetables fried for ten seconds as some sort of culinary revelation, stay away if you actually enjoy eating your food and don’t expect to shell out 370DKK for what amounts to four lots of cabbage and utterly non existent service. Would sooner eat grass from a park and pay 50DKK to do so than eat here again.",1

We decided we would treat ourselves to some fancy food, and we chose this place. Well, I really wish we hadn't. We knew the food was a little different to what we're used to, but we thought we'd give it a go and if we didn't like it, oh well! We ordered the tasting menu, and a beer/cider. The cider was rank, so bitter. The first course was just raw vegetables, it did not taste good. Then the tartare came out.. and again, we just really didn't like it. So, we thought that we should just cut our losses, pay what we owe and leave (without complaint). I spoke to a staff member (who was extremely rude, took it as a personal insult - but that raw food just isn't my style), and we paid what we owed and decided to leave. Whilst we were gathering our stuff, a staff member said to us that he hopes we can get somewhere better in Copenhagen - obviously a cheeky remark, but I could eat better - at McDonald's! Honestly, we didn't mind that the food wasn't to our liking, it was the behaviour of the staff members that made me angry. There was no reason to be rude to us, and so I really wouldn't recommend this place.",1

I went for the tasting menu and found the food to be of good quality, and the combinations interesting. I requested dairy free, which although it was no problem I felt that one or two of the dishes could have been adapted better rather than simply removing the dairy aspect. For example, there was an endive salad with citrus dressing that had toasted walnuts, our neighbors at the next table ordered the same tasting menu but with dairy and had theirs with parmesan shavings. For mine I personally would have substituted sea salt flakes for the parmesan to give the citrus a salty counterbalance in place of the but this is simply my vie ",5

We don't subscribe to any particular eating ideology - organic or non-organic, meat or veg, if it's well produced and prepared and above all tasty, we'll eat it. Manfred's is more organic/vegetable based than we would normally pick, and also one of the best meals we've had for a while. Out of the seven complex courses, our favourite was the thinly sliced black radish and celeriac, with capers, nasturtium leaves, sunflower seed hummus and brown butter - astonishingly flavoursome. To list all the ingredients in the other six courses would exhaust my typing skills, but all were unusual but successful combinations, there were even a couple of small contributions from the animal kingdom (mussels, a confit duck leg, cheese). The smoked beetroot deserves a mention too, and the summer greens from the farm with salsa verde. And the bread was outstanding (and not counted as one of the seven courses ",5

We had a fantastic natural unfiltered sparkling wine from Italy that we liked so much we bought a bottle to go. The servers were great about letting us try a number of wines before we settled on one.

But the ambience is that of a decaying biker club, toilets awful, chairs falling apart (the seat was completely loose on mine). walls actually crumbling. Not bohemian-nice, but downright shoddy. The 7 course chefs choice was close to what I had before (two years ago), no new ideas? Celery dish was drenched in vinegar, dont they taste? They forgot courses, and its a mystery why they cant state the menu of the day, but leave it to chance whats coming. Some stuff were really nice, but underpresented. They forgot us when paytime came... naaahh. Concept tired. Not coming back I think.",3
Manfreds,E1621PWnicolem,"May 9, 2018",Highly overrated,"We were 6 friends all ordering the 7 course chefs menu. We were served 6 different varieties of not very exiting vegetable dishes f.inst. fried broccoli, radishes etc. one small dish had tiny slices of steak. Several at the table had knowledge of wine and tried to discuss with the waiter to get some good wines regardless of the price and still we ended up with some really poor tasting wines. To top it all up we were unable to get the dessert because the kitchen could not manage to get the ice machine to work, they were unable to serve hot milk with the coffee and tea was not something they served at all. We were then presented with a bill of almost DKK 4000 for 6 people and were asked to leave the table because the next party was waiting. Do I need to say that we are not coming back!",1

Yes, the tartare is one of the most photographed dishes in CPH, but it's also one of the very best. The staff were so kind and welcoming when we returned, and the wine selection is flawless.

Manfreds,Sampsa W,"April 10, 2018",Very interesting take on vegetarian dishes,"Me and my wife visited Manfreds in 4/2018 and were very pleased with the restaurant. We had the Chef's Special with wine menus and found them rather interesting and tasty. The wines were kind of peculiar and we were not able to decide whether we liked them or not. I would say, however, that yes. All of the portions were very good, out of the seven dishes served we both only had one dish that didn't speak to us (for me it was mushrooms, for my wife some raw vegetables). I also had the tartar as a starter, but didn't like it as much as I imagined based on earlier reviews. When we ordered the Chef's Special we mentioned that my wife doesn't eat ""red meat"", however the final dish was a Wiener Schnitzel. I guess that in some countries pork doesn't count as a red meat like it does in Finland. They did replace the dish, though, with very tasteful squid. All in all, I would visit Manfreds again and suggest everyone to give it a try. Interesting, tasty and one of a kind place.",4

One of the set menu items was salad greens, celery chunks and toasted walnuts served on a thin slice of toasted sourdough bread, with pistachio compote spread. Another dish was red beets with pumpkin purée, garnished with pumpkin seeds. Both dishes were amazing. Our favorite dish was the beef tartare, served with fresh rye bread.",5

While the dishes were all fairly tasty, they didn't blow me away. It seems the chef has found a format that he likes - a schmear or puree on the bottom, the main ingredient blanched or lightly cooked on that with a crunch of nuts or sprinkle of cheese on top to give different textures. While it worked in most cases, it did become a little predictable and not overly exciting and a couple of the dishes were a little bland. Overall it was good for what we paid, but I've had better.

Manfreds,SonHen,"September 17, 2017",Vegetarian-ish,"It's true what they say about the tartare - we ordered a medium each and we both thought it was excellent. Then we had the tasting menu with wine pairing. The dishes were vegetarian, with the exceptions being a ceviche-like mackerel with fresh and pickled daikon, a poached egg yolk, and tender lamb pieces served with kale. I like that their dishes had a high vegetable-to-meat ratio. And the vegetable dishes were all very tasty. Wines were also very good, but 3 glasses each would not be enough, so we ended up with a glass more each. Food and service were all nice (specially the humorous young man server/bartender) but we cannot see ourselves coming here regularly. It was a good adventure.",4

It is a cozy, downstairs spot and our waiter greeted us with, ""Welcome to the cave."" The food is vegetable focused but some meat and fish as well. We ordered the tasting menu with a wine pairing and a large order of their famous steak tartare to share between the four of us. There were seven courses of delicious vegetable based dishes. Two dishes had some meat-mackerel with haricot vert, fava beans, and chard and braised lamb with bok choy. Other dishes included baby corn, beets, cauliflower, etc. All creatively prepared and yummy! The three wines were described as ""a little funky"" and lived up to this description. Maybe not what I would pick every night, but well paired with the whole mood of the evening. The waiter was very friendly and the whole staff was attentive. Prices are a little steep, but we all really enjoyed the whole evening.",4

The atmosphere was really enjoyable and the mainly vegetarian dishes we loved. We found them interesting and filling. We just had a bottle of wine so didn't have the taster wine suggested. All in all our group loved this place and the younger members amongst us, who are in their twenties, found this to be their favourite restaurant of our whole trip.

In this he was very true to his word. We endured 7 dishes of vegetables some undercooked, some charred with a blowtorch. Eating undercooked spring onions is not my idea of a culinary highlight. The wine helped but as each new dish of green vegetables appeared we longed for a tasting menu that was tasty. I like vegetables but not if your'e paying £160 for 3 people!

Once we got there the laid back, hipster atmosphere of this smallish restaurant made us glad we had come. The tasting menu is heavy on very fresh vegetables grown in their own gardens (not close to the restaurant location). Courses featured a wonderful blend of tastes and textures. The staff was charming and very attentive and the evening was very enjoyable. Our only suggestion is that the plates be cleared between courses...a small matter and easy to remedy. ",4
Manfreds,LosAngelesRon,"July 24, 2017",Good vibes and good food outside of the city center,"From the pleasant greeting (your table will be ready in 20 seconds -- and it was), to the engaging waitress--loved her French accent--we found Manfreds' to be a culinary delight. The tartare was, as promised, splendid. I'm not a meat eater but decided to indulge because it's the signature dish. It was worth it. Quite delicious and interestingly mixed with greens and other tasty morsels. The following 7 courses were equally intriguing. Though some were better than others, the mix of fresh vegetables (heavy on the lettuce) and light sauces made for a quite enjoyable meal. Remember: they feature their own, self-grown vegetables. Not a vegetarian restaurant but heavy on the veggies. The penultimate course of cabbage in a beurre blanc was surprisingly good -- I mean what besides sauer kraut picks up a green cabbage? The final dish of lamb belly was also quite good (again worth breaking the no-meat pledge--it's a vacation after all!). We found the staff delightful and the food well prepared and worthy of ""foody"" status. The only complaint was that they tended to leave the plates on the table even as the next course arrived. For very casual, hipster, gourmet -- this place fits the bill!",4
Manfreds,William E,"July 21, 2017",7 course menu was very disappointing,"So overrated. We opted for the 7 course tasting dinner, which was a real disappointment. Only one of the dishes had meat, and most of them were just heavily sauced vegetables. We've honestly had salads that were better than all courses combined (which is what the daily special looked like, for about half the price). Of the five wines we tried throughout the evening all had strong vinegary notes of oxidation characteristic of organic wines that have been open too long. Vinegar flavors were also a theme across the dishes, which was not exactly the kind of pairing we were hoping for. This place did not live up to the hype or its price point. I was going to add that the staff were at least nice, but later in the evening none of our guests could recall receiving a seventh dish, which we suspect was not served. In any case, it certainly wasn't memorable. Don't make the mistake of wasting an evening here.",1

The staff was incredibly friendly in accommodating us (one vegetarian, one gluten-allergy). We did sit in the window row which was fortunate on a bright (but cold) summer night and added to the good atmosphere. I have not been to Manfreds the last couple of years after moving overseas, but it was a very good return to a favourite place that still lives up to its reputation for high quality food and wine and an urban vibe.

His sauces were complex and delicious and his ability to put combinations of foods together to create an amazing sensory experience was remarkable.

Your place, the people making it run smoothly behind the scenes and front of house, you guys have done a stellar job. We went to Manfreds on a saturday night with a really food obsessed couple. We had mentioned that Scandinavian staff can be a little less likely to ""banter"" with patrons than in the UK, US or Ireland but boy, were we wrong. The servers were brilliant. I think each came and added a little something to the service over the course of our long, delicious and unique dining experience. We opted to have our server select our wines, and my wife who is pescatarian had him select one that paired well with the very vegetarian friendly selection. Highlights were the chicken, the fish and the goats cheese dishes. The cloudy wine we had last, i wish we had asked what it was but it was killer! Really good all round. We did remember to ask about the music playing though - the playlist was on point. The atmosphere was great, the guys all clearly work with pride for the place, who they are and what they are about. It carried through and we left feeling like we had been part of something special. Everything youll eat and drink is sourced thoughtfully by Manfreds and you can feel it. This place is just great. It helps that jægersbrogade is a great street with ample selection of pre & post dinner drinks. Thanks all at Manfreds & Vin! ",5

We were sat at a table about 3 inches apart from the next one so absolutely no privacy and could hear everything said on the next table. I love food and am prepared to try anything but most of the food hadn't even been cooked so prep must have taken moments. The wine was not pleasant at all. It seems they are trying too hard to be different and whacky and people are falling for it. Spoke to many people who said that very few locals frequent it. I can see why. Desperately expensive/poor value for money. We were also given 3 tiny pieces of lamb between 2 of us. Why not 4 for that money?,2

I think the main ingredient of the seven course are: shaved common mushrooms, some type of root vege, pumpkin, corn as in corn on the cob, tomatoes, rabbit in shredded small pieces, and tiny pieces of cod. Lots of creamy sauce. Salty. Messy presentation. Can't say that any of these have good flavours. No deserts included in the tasting menu. Did not change plates between courses, but we were fortunate to have ordered a starter of beef tartar before the tasting menu. This came with a large portion of sourdough bread. We use the sourdough to mop up the plates in between courses. ",2

The servers are flushed from what I imagine is the routine; quick setup and opening followed by a rush of patrons eager to engage their daily specials. The tasting menu felt the way to go, and an evenly paced treat-after-treat service began. The textures in all dishes were perfect, the flavors were very well balanced and the presentation vibrant. My chosen libation; the local cider which stood apart and drinks more like a light, earthy beer and less like a sweet cider. Joel, the chef that day was very friendly and knowledgable.

If you don’t have a reservation at Christian Puglisi’s Relae, do not feel short-changed if they point you to Manfred’s. The standard of food and service is just as good there. We dropped in the night after our Relae treat and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table, again perched high watching the kitchen. We had dish of the day, green dish of the day and green salad to share. Some lovely fresh and unexpected flavours. Then we fought over which dessert was better – the chocolate mousse or the rhubarb crumble? The jury is still out. ",5

This is New Danish cuisine in an intimate (read: small) dining room. Fixed menu for the most part--you're going to get dishes made for everyone that night, though they can adapt for allergies. The dishes are served attractively but not artistically--and that's fine by me. Several of the dishes struck me as highly original. The steak tartare, I've heard, draws chefs from around the city, it's that good. I didn't love it (the texture gives me the creeps) but the flavor was striking and I still ate it... The grilled green onions were wonderful wonderful wonderful. The pork was succulent. The chocolate mouse with olive oil and breadcrumbs was fascinating, even if not my favorite. The wines here emphasize natural, including spontaneously fermented, which means they're earthy and special, like lambic beers. Definitely worth asking for their recommendations, because it isn't a typical wine list. The service was steady and good. Overall, it is places like Manfred's that are the reason foodies go to Copenhagen. If you have to ask how much it costs...you shouldn't be eating out in a Copenhagen restaurant.",5

We had a vegan with us, and three others who did not eat meat, and this restaurant handled that without a hesitation (they seemed very proud that they could do it so readily); and wasn't like a quality compromise for the vegan, she seemed to us to have the best dessert, something they custom prepared for her on short notice.

So glad we did. First off - we couldn't stop eating the bread- crusty, tangy sourdough with good butter and pleasingly grey sea salt. The courses arrived randomly but they were all explained with knowledge, intelligence and passion- the French chef was keen to engage in finding the English translation for ramsom- (wild garlic). The tartare is celebrated and indeed deserves its reputation. It was buttery soft and subtley flavoured. The pork with Kale was divine and i was tempted to lick the plate. Everything is organic and so equates to heaven for me- the glass of bubbles was unfiltered and therefore a bit cloudy but nevertheless delicious. The area is undergoing gentrification and you can find a cool coffee shop on every corner together with craft jewellers and the like- well worth the trip from the city centre.",5
Manfreds,Louise C,"March 27, 2016",Best meal of our trip! ,"Organic food and wine at good prices with great service. The restaurant it's self is intimate and relaxed, the staff made you feel welcome and their style was casual, friendly and their knowledge of the product was spot on. You could taste how fresh and organic the produce was. We had 2 starters which included the beautiful tartare, which just melted in your mouth and we both had the daily special of braised beef with lentils and kale. It was so rich and tasty. If I could even cook kale like that I would be super proud! We had 3 desserts; cheese which was similar to comte', the milk ice cream and the chocolate mousse. I have to admit I would have preferred the mousse with less olive oil but it worked. The wines were all so clear and pure and the dessert wine was a winner! The bill was DKK1020 about £100 which included 6 drinks, 2 started, 2 mains and 3 desserts. The best meal we had in Copenhagen and the cheapest! Would recommend this popular place for sure! ",5

I absolutely love the style of cooking Manfreds has to offer. Local, free range, zero mileage, seasonal food and you can really tell. The cooking is exceptional and each dish is really well thought out, incorporating really interesting styles and techniques of cooking, as a training chef it was an absolute pleasure dining here.

One of the dishes had meat in it, but since I am a vegetarian, they happily and readily offered to replace it with something else! Every dish was delicious! I only have one comment, and that is that the dishes are quite big! I was very very full after the 5 course meal (although... that can't really be counted as a bad thing)!

We asked to order from the a la carte menu, but she refused and told us that the policy for this restaurant was, that more than 8 guests then you have to order the menu, we asked to order 7 times tartare as the 8 guests was not very hungry, so she accepted and then we asked if it could be right that we could not order another tartare. All in all a very disappointment to visit this restaurant with non flexible staff and a very arrogant service. We dine all over the world and I have never tried such a strange policy, if you book a table for lunch you should not have to eat a 5 course menu, and if so it would be nice to have known in advance, so we could have changed to another restaurant.

Manfreds,LONGJOHNSILVERSS,"December 7, 2015",GHASTLY CULINARY EXPERIENCE,"We had the 7-course taster menu with 3 glasses of wine specially selected by the Sommelier. The 7 courses consisted of onions, leeks, curly kale, yellow beetroot, lamb and trout. Each course had a horrible sour taste as if the chef kept a large jug of vinegar close to hand and splashed it liberally over every plate before serving. Truly horrible food, only outdone by the absolutely revolting wine. The young staff had clearly been trained to explain how the wines were unique, with aromatic hints etc. In fact they were absolute vinegar. I asked to see the bottle of the final red wine and found that it was an Italian Vino de Tavola (table wine) at only 10.5% alcohol, dated 2014. i.e. a very young, extremely weak, watery vinegar and yet the 3 glasses were priced at 250 Kroner or (£25)...scandalous. By the look of the young, hipster clientele, this is a trendy eatery where the management think they can fool people to part with their cash for low quality food and wine.

We paid 70 euros for two totally underwhelming brunch dishes and two glasses of wine. The food looked nice but was average and tasteless. My partner had the meat dish which was topped with vegetables in some sort of lemon dressing which soaked into the meat sauce and made the dish bitter. My eggs benedict just did not work either - the celeriac was raw and just didn't taste great.

It suppose to be a restaurant not tasting place. For 250 DKK (33 EUR) they should offer much more. First, we asked for a wine. We choose one Italian wine and the waiter was cleaver enough to pour just just for taste. It must be the worst wine taste ever. The highlight of the dinner was ""organic"" lamb consist of few very small peaces half fat, half meat. When I asked about this, the waitress, very confident replied ""but it is because they are organic"". The place looks very cheap, bad food and far above average price.

So, how could things go so wrong? Good food? Check. Good Wine? Check? Good Service? Check! Good atmosphere? Check! Synergy? No, No, No!!!! Nothing matched, and some of the ""fancy"" food (stick to stuff you know and can do!) had no chance with ANY wine. The menu was not very large, some starters, a steak tartar and a seven, yes seven course fixed menu, next to this was a Sommeliers Special of 3 recommended wines. We ordered the 7 courses and the 3 wines. Nothing matched, although to be fair after we were nearly finished and had complained they said the wines were just good, not meant to match! Somebody needs to get a grip here. It could be so much better, but the kitchen and service need to be together to provide the guests with something worth eating and drinking because as it is now just does not work AT ALL!

I hated the decor, the staff,the food and the wine and the prices too. The only good thing about the place is nothing.",1
Manfreds,thewestcountry,"October 6, 2015",Disappointing 2nd visit,"Visited 2 years ago and loved the wine bar. Came back in August 2015 and were extremely disappointed. Staff were superficially friendly, but pushy, trying to get you to order the tartar. The wine pairing was rushed. At one stage there were two glasses of full wine on each of our place setting a red and a white. The poached egg was underdone, quite raw. Celeriac was undercooked, and was too hard to bite. I had to leave a piece even though I was starving. When I mentioned this to the waitress she sneered and said ""well if that's what you think"". If you're going to cook simple food, it has to be GREAT. This was a case of the chef ego taking over the restaurant. The bill came and we were astounded at the lack of value we got. A shame because the place could be something special, and it used to be. I won't be going bac ",2
Manfreds,Aminowichsky,"October 2, 2015",How can it go so wrong?,"You take very very good high quality ingredients, prepare it in a well equipped kitchen. serve it perfectly by the nicest of staff in the coziest environment, while nice music is played - can it go wrong? yes it can. We had some very fine on the menu small dishes: tartar, Vittelo Tonato, some poached egg with corn and some salad. The tartar meat was wonderful but was served with fried rye bread crumbs on a mayonaise tasting sause - so it just didnt taste good, nor was a pleasure to bite in. (but it looked good). The poached egg with corn was actually corn with poached egg - you just couldnt taste anything but the corn (looked ok though). The salad had too much saury dressing on. I had a bobly wine, which was dead and looked like beer. the secret of failiour: when you try too hard, think too much and over do the concept. My advice: take it easier people - with your ingredients and good people, you just cant go wrong - so just dont go wrong - take it easy and all will be good.",2

Mine was superb, pork in a lemon sauce, the pork was melt in the mouth and probably one of the best pieces of pork I have ever eaten. It came with couscous and buckwheat, which were also tasty, but I did leave some as I just couldn't manage the whole plate - I have a very healthy appetite.

After completing the last course, I was left wanting as the food was truly in sampling portions. There was originality in the offerings and the food was fresh but not much else to shout about. Be prepared to order more food after the degustation. The tables were also packed very close together to maximize sitting capacity, and I felt uncomfortably cramped when seated. The low ceiling and packed tables contributed to a noisy ambience. Service standard is acceptable for a busy night. I would suggest outdoor seating for a quiet dining experience, but then one has to contend with the smokers. Take your pick.",3

The type of restaurant has become to Copenhagen what tapas has become worldwide, a system of ordering and experimenting with different flavors in a special setting. For Denmark this means ordering an assortment of plates and sharing on the table. Most people find the prix fixe menu a better value, and we went along with the suggestion. After so many good places in the City, i have to admit i was disappointed with the flavors. Several of the courses tried too hard to appear different from each other but were heavily coated with sauces that made them seem all the same.

From the most excellent servers -- who know both food and wine -- to the soundtrack that softly played, everything about this restaurant was unique and well thought through. The decor, hip and rough may not be for everyone (especially for tourists who like the city center), but I could see making this an oft-visited place.

For those unsure, this means that the wine is prepared without adding extra yeast/suga ",5
Manfreds,bryonybooth,"January 19, 2015","Delicious food, wine and hygge!",Manfred’s was the best meal that we had during our stay in Copenhagen. We opted to have the tasting menu of 7 different dishes each of which was brought over by the chef who cooked it and explained (in perfect English!). I think my favourite was a delicious minced carrot and goats cheese dish – so tasty and like nothing I had eaten before. We also opted for the 3 different wines which went with the meal and again were all explained by the lovely waitress. The restaurant is small and cosy and gave us the sense of ‘hygge’ which we heard a lot about during our stay! The food was excellent quality and I think very reasonably priced for such a delicious meal.,5

The first course, kale with anchovy cream and walnuts was good, and the mushroom soup was delicious. The next three courses, all root vegetables , were not good. The roasted artichokes with olive sauce were literally burnt to a cinder and the sauce lacked flavour. The carrots with seaweed sauce were ok, but dull. The beetroot with a beer sauce was so salty that it was inedible. We left most of the artichoke and beetroot- the waiting staff did not ask why, or if we had enjoyed the meal (which we clearly hadn't!). The wine as good. Left feeling hungry and craving a cinnamon bun. Definitely not recommended I'm afraid.",2

The mushroom soup was delicious. Carrots on their own don't do much for me but seriously undercooked celeriac served in huge inedible lumps is ghastly. The beef was fine but however open minded I am I would have preferred it with the earlier vegetables rather than served later. Perhaps all of this would have been ok if the service was warm and pleasant but sadly the girl serving us was extremely cool and just didn't appear very interested in us or the food. Not great ,2

We opted for their five course lunchtime tasting menu (fairly reasonably priced) and had a lovely bottle of wine (they only serve 'natural' wine) Mostly vegetarian, each of the courses were delicious. A broccoli salad with salted apples and nuts, Celeriac soup with thyme (the best Celeriac soup I've ever had) Roasted carrots in seaweed sauce, cucumber with nasturtium and an ending course of very tender lamb.

Manfred's came highly recommended by many locals - as well as by the owner of Noma in a NYT article. We absolutely loved it. So much so that we ate there twice in three days. On our first visit we had the 7 course tasting menu, which is a steal at 250K per person. Each course was better than the last, and the natural wines that accompanied the meal were also excellent. Our next visit was impromptu, but we only waited about a half hour without a reservation. (And there is lots to do on Jaegersborggade while we waited.) This time we were seated at a bar facing the kitchen (dinner and a show!) and decided to share the Dish of the Day and Green of the Day. This option was great because it gave us so much food we had leftovers for dinner the next day. Two additional plusses are that 1) it is open on Sunday and Monday - which is quite rare amongst the great restaurants in CPH and 2) they offer a (limited but adequate) takeaway menu.",5

The menu warns that the majority of the dishes will be vegetarian and dependent on what produce they have on the day. However, we were served delicious salmon, slow cooked beef, rare beef as well as some of the most delicious vegetarian plates. It was a shame we couldn't fork out on wine but for £25 I would definitely recommend it. It was probably the highlight meal of our 3 week holiday.",5

Just a small amount of meat, so if you aren't fine with that, this may not be your place (seems to be an underlying reason to some of the less than stellar reviews here). The staff very friendly, sommelier very knowledgable and told us a bit about the wines he was pouring, and each complemented the tastings nicely. I am an average eater (portion size-wise), and found the seven tastings to be just the right amount of food. Regarding the prices... For the quality and experience I did not feel this was too expensive as a few reviewers did. Food in Copenhagen is expensive, and I would much rather pay for a quality, interesting and well prepared meal, than spend the same amount or less on something that is just average. The food here was worth very penny (or dkk!). Go, eat, enjoy... ",5

We loved it--seasonal veggie dishes such as cauliflower, picked kholrabi, grilled cabbage, roasted white radishes all sauced interestingly, plus smoked trout, a poached egg over warm grains, and sliced tenderloin.

But the wine! It really is pretty dreadful. Having drunk biodynamic wine before we understand the principle. And it can be interesting and quirky. But this selection of cloudy, rough wines with a finish that lasts about a nanosecond ( probably a good thing) were very poor.

Manfreds,Pietro A,"May 9, 2013","High expectance, poor experience","We visited this wine-bar that was suggested by a friend, considering it as a good compromise between a ""NOMA style"" experience and a reasonable bill. The place is crowded and the atmosphere was all but cozy. Some of the waiters were very kind and professionals, and other not. We chose the ""chef's choice"", and we got 7 small course to share. The presentation of the courses were not enough good in my opinion, we barely were informed about the content. About the wine, one of the waiters offered to suggest a couple of bottles, and we opted for one of them. We were not informed about the price, and at the end it was about 65 €, more than 50% of the amount of the bill (the actual price of the bottle found on the internet was about 12-16 €!). Of course this was also our mistake, but I think it's not fair to suggest an expensive bottle without informing the clients. Concerning the food, we remained disappointed: many of the courses were crudités or basically cooked, we were expecting something different. Summarizing, it could be good to drink a glass of biologic wine (the cellar is big and full of bottles) - knowing well the price in advance! - but we can't suggest it for a dinner.",1

We had the set menu for three where they bring along a variety of different dishes in turn. Lots of interesting flavours happening, such as brocolli and walnut, burnt carrot and juniper berry. The reason for four stars is mainly that it was quite expensive for the amount of food given (tiny portions) and while the flavours were interesting and nice, I couldn't say any of them were surely *delicious*. I really liked the concept of not knowing in advance what the food would be though, it's far more invigorating that way",4

Every dish was delicious and even though we ordered a glass of the cheaper wine, it was still amongst the best I've had.

Small, straightforward dishes, all very tasty with flavors that I can't describe other than ""funky and real"". Roasted pumpkin with watercress-paste, toasted fennel, cauliflower with beetroot and roasted almonds. Strong contrasting flavors that complemented nicely. I don't know much about wines but what I can tell you is that I loved all of the three wines that we tasted. Also good 'contrast' here; one of the whites was cider-like, the red one really smooth.

The reservation was made on-line, not sure whether it was needed, but they were ready for us and seated us inside - after 9:00 PM the sidewalk tables are closed so as to not disturb the neighbours. The wine list and food list is confusing - not because it is unclear but because it is unlikely you are familiar with the products - heavy on organic boutique products. So we opted for the set menu for 2: 4 veggie dishes, 2 egg, 2 fish/meat and 4 accompanying wines. This is their place, they know their product so let them put their best foot forward.

The rough walls, and chairs that look as if they were reclaimed from a handful of local Mor Mor’s or Far Mor’s (grandmothers) and pushed up against reclaimed school library tables from the ‘60’s just made it more fun. Ok, while I can understand how it might get hot inside during the winter, when we were there, in the throes of Denmark’s Green Winter (a.k.a. summer) it was lovely. Yes, the tables are close together, however, it simply makes dining a sociable event as great food and wine quickly wipes out the stoic silent nature in the most socially reclusive Dane!

The gloss on the sauce was fabulous. My partner had crispy skin salmon that was cooked to perfection. We managed to thank the chefs personally. To drink we opted for a Carlsberg beer. It can be a little pricey but it is in a 5 star hotel. A couple of negative points that didn't spoil our experience. The rest rooms are down a spiral staircase and as we both have mobility issues it was not easy. Finally they need to do something about air freshners or something in the men's rest room.

BOB Biomio Organic Bistro,thevegetarianfoodie,"October 20, 2017",Lovely but pricey food,"Visited Copenhagen with my brother and we came in here one evening as i am vegan and on trip advisor it said it had vegan options. The menu was fairly small but a good variety and vegetarian and vegan options were clearly labelled which helped me out lots! My brother had the fish of the day which he said was delicious and I had the broccoli and fennel which was also yummy, however at 160 krona for a meal based around vegetables seemed very pricey even though, as I say it was delicious. We also had the focaccia which came in a very full basket and was nice. Service was fine and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. ",3

The cauliflower soup was very good--mostly like a cream soup with big chunks of pickled cauliflower. The mains and dessert were thoughtful and interesting--there was always one ingredient that showed some inspiration. E.g., pickled rhubarb on white chocolate sorbet. The day we ate it was unusually warm in Copenhagen and the restaurant was really warm; tables close to the open doors were a lot better off. I wasn't paying the bill, so I didn't complain about the wine, but I thought the water situation was a bit odd. Our party asked for tap water--that's the sustainable drink, right?--but they offer sparkling or still in bottles. Only, these are bottled themselves. Why are they doing this and charging for it? Really people: just allow us to have unlimited tap water. It's no fun eating a dinner and stressing about how you should watch how much water you drink for fear that it will up the bill!

Now, don't be confused, but you can't miss the restaurant as it has a massive BOSCH neon light at the front. We went on a busy Friday night and were lucky to get in. I would probably book to get a better table. Bob has a great atmosphere and this is a happening area of Copenhagen. The menu had few choices, but why make things complicated? Our waiter was really helpful and attended quickly to bringing drinks and food. We settled for a bottle of wine - which is VERY expensive but we were on holiday. The ""prison food"" - bread and water with oil was tasty. I had a burger and my other half had the vegetarian option. These were cooked well and tasty.

When we finally flagged someone down and ordered they brought the wrong wine. We both had the burger, but despite asking for it to be well done it came almost cold and pink through the middle, and it had more than my own body weight in fried onions.

We told that we were so hungry that couldn't have waiten any longer. He kept telling it's our fault that we didn't tell earlier and now there is nothing to be done. We told he could at least say he's sorry and after that he repeated the phrase he's sorry and offered coffee/tea. We were so disappointed that we declined.

However, I have been here now 3 times, and service has been pretty average each time and food has been a bit cold sometimes (when served a hot dish). Last time I visited, my partner found a bit of a plastic spoon in his dish, which is just not acceptable. The food is very nice but has also been a bit hit and miss... It's a shame, because it is a nice place and it has potential for improvement.",3

It is very informal in the Vesterbro neighborhood with those long comunal tables. Service was good, and we also enjoyed the food. We tried a starter, a butcher's cut, which was nothing memorable, but the cod and pork main dishes were very good. The beer was also very tasty.

BOB Biomio Organic Bistro,Smooth8,"October 15, 2015","Good experience, unusual food","Bio Mio is an interesting concept - it has the whole organic thing going on and the main dishes involve unusual pairings of ingredients, that being said, I feel sometimes it's unusual to be unusual rather than delicious... It's also a little pricier than I think it should be, on top of the starter and main and glass of wine (45 Euros), bread is an additional 25 krone (3 Euro) per person and the whole table must order it... (I think bread should be included at any mid-range to expensive restaurant). The service was excellent - cheerful and happy to be talking to customers. I had a delicious salad - the roasted beet salad is amazing!! My main was the barley risotto with mushrooms, califlower and toasted hazelnut, I think there was also something pickled in there. It was unusual and you were able to experience multiple flavours in every bite, but I felt it was trying too hard. We also ordered the dish of the day - also a melange of flavours and items and the fish. There wasn't much effort in the presentation of the dishes ",4

Having received vague directions from a local bar we made our way down narrow streets and across busy boulevards. There is no mistaking that you have found the right place...there is an ambiance and atmosphere that is difficult to define. There is a buzz but a sense of tranquillity at the same time...lots of people but still quite intimate. The first place we checked out was BioMio...primarily because of the huge illuminated Bosch sigh over the entrance. It looked casual and inviting but we still wanted to check out some of the other numerous restaurants in the area. Didn't want to admit that we were taken in by the neon sign etc. Nonetheless, having checked our several other restaurants, all of which had their merits we were still drawn back to the neon light like moths to a street lamp! So in we went, immediately impressed by the polite welcome and almost immediately shown to a table. We sat on the cafe style high chairs and rustic wooden bench arrangement. The menu is also rustic but presented in a skilled and inventive manner. Everything on the menu is guaranteed organic. It’s a sign of a good menu when it's difficult to choose a meal. I went for the enormous beef burger (medium rare!) and my wife went for the fish...both absolutely superb...enough said!",5

The organic feeling extends to the furnishings, plenty of live greenery and tole lanterns surround you. Very friendly, nicely paced service, excellent food! They offer something to please everybody, from the strictest vegan to the avowed meat eater. Be prepared to pay for tap water, it helps to ask ahead of time, as we learned. We ordered beef stew with oyster mushrooms, rice, gravy and arugula, and creamy polenta with celery root, mushrooms and Romesco Sauce, and we both cleaned our plates!

Firstly the waitress at the front desk told us we couldn't get a table because they were full, fair enough, but there were loads of tables outside! So she sat us outside and proceeded to leave us there for at least 15 before I went back into the restaurant and asked if we could order. She said she was busy and would come when she could. 5 minutes later she came out and served another table, walking straight past us, but clearly ignoring us. Another 5 minutes later a different waiter came out and asked if we had been served. We proceeded to place an order, and instead of getting the burger, on his recommendation we ordered a beef dish served with sauce, and the mussels. When the food arrived I was brought scallops instead of mussels and the waiter apologised and went to get me mussels instead. No sooner had he gone when we discovered the beef dish was actually CHICKEN curry! We alerted a waitress who was apologetic but who didn't know what to do. My mussels appeared and the curry was sent back to be replaced with the burger. The burger took another 20minutes to arrive by which time I had finished the mussels. The burger was bland and tasteless and with truly mediocre potatoes on the side. The meat was good quality but really that was the only saving grace. We felt that the staff didn't really care about serving us and didn't care much that they had made such a big mess of our dinner, no offer was made to take drinks off the bill for example. It was really overpriced considering the distinctly average food and bad service. I would NOT recommend this restaurant at all!",1

The staff were really friendly and helpful and seated me where I would feel comfortable on my own. The main special was braised beef with pumpkin, glazed beetroot and mash and was on the table about 5' after I ordered it. I know solo diners may not like to wait too long but this was way too short ( and meant this was all pre prepared food). The food was tasty, but unexciting. But was filling. The side of mash was very large. There was a reasonable range of wines by the glass as well as an interesting cocktail and beet menu. The cheese platter of three generous serves of cheese came with pickled walnuts and chutney.

It is extremely hipster, like they are trying their utmost to make it this way. Almost a bit comical but if you don't mind it's a great place to have lunch or dinner. It is run by Norrebro Beer Brewery and thus they have that for their in-house beer selection. Prices might be considered a bit steep but when all things come around it's worth it.

This gave a very informal and fun atmosphere. As a family we already had noticed it had gone down in quality. Smaller portions, less tasty food. Now our daughter took some friends there today and she was so extremely disappointed.

My partner had a stunningly bland (no salt) mishmash of something the restaurant quite liberally calls ""gnocchi"", mushrooms, vegetables, and a cold red pepper sauce that completely overpowered the subtle flavour of the mushrooms. This dish tried to be a lot of things and ended up being a confused mess, without any real grasp of suitable flavour combinations. I had an ordinary salmon with fennel and leek. Although it was seasoned better than the aforementioned dish, nothing raised it to the level that its price suggested. 500 DK (70 €) for these two dishes and two bottles of beer adds up to a very poor quality-to-money ratio.

The most important problem was, however, that the food we were served was virtually tasteless, which is a dramatic change from previous experiences. The waiter was very nice and attentive.",2

BOB Biomio Organic Bistro,Claire J,"January 8, 2014",Unbelievably overpriced brunch,"I went to BioMio for brunch on my last day in Copenhagen. It was a help yourself buffet affair and the only thing available in the restaurant on the Sunday morning we went. There was no indication of the price anywhere, but we figured, well how much could a brunch buffet really be?! So we went ahead. The buffet itself was good, lots of variety including fresh fruit, breads, some cooked items, pates etc, typically Danish in style. The drinks were ordered separately and weren't included in the price. Obviously you could go up and refill your plate as many times as you wanted, though after a little bit of everything we found we were extremely full and didn't go back for me. On top of the buffet we had two hot drinks between us and a bottle of juice to share. We went went to pay (you pay at the cash desk when you leave) we were utterly shellshocked to discover the bill was 550dk, that's over £60!! I suppose the idea is perhaps you stay for hours and hours and keep loading up for plate, but really, how much can one person eat?! And despite this, I don't think that thing like fresh fruit, bread etc are costly items - they aren't cooked, there is no table service etc. I only wish we had checked the price when we entered, I know Copenhagen is expensive, but this was more expensive than a lovely dinner we had at neighbouring Mother restaurant the night before - which included starters, 2 pizzas, 3 beers, a cocktail and a coke. Be warned, only go for the BioMio brunch if you are planning on eating A LOT!",2

The Lumpfish roe, was served with in my view too much double creme but good idea to have added smoked Lumpfish. The dishes were served rather theater-like - enormous plate to small pancake for the Lumpfish...back to the eighties - been there, done that, moved on. Wines were good and the waitress explaining as well food as wine was very competent. One of these middle-class restaurant a bit pretentious that there are so many of.

Restaurant Trio,morl8tr,"December 30, 2017",A strong new player in great restaurant city,"This is a new sister restaurant to the 2-Michelin star AOC, and to the also excellent but somewhat less acclaimed Restaurant No. 2. Trio is located in a newly erected building, one of two golden cylindrical towers just across from Tivoli. The restaurant occupies floors 8 though 10, and because Copenhagen has few tall buildings, the view over Copenhagen is very nice. The setting, interior design, and ambiance are a significant strength, enjoyable before, during, and after your meal. There is a cocktail bar on the 9th floor, with a menu of original cocktails specific to this restaurant (though they can do the classics as well, I presume). The 8th floor is a space for private dining with a capacity of approximately 40 or 50. We secured the 8th floor space for a wedding dinner, and they let us have the space from afternoon to 2 AM. The service was excellent. In planning they were always available, and provided great flexibility in set up and other options. We chose a 7 course tasting menu and also matching wine or cocktail course (you could choose one or the other -- they also allowed people to switch from wine to cocktails during the meal, which a couple of people did because the cocktails seemed so intriguing). They brought snacks before the meal (oysters, a sort of perch dumpling, and a crispy biscuit with cheese) and they also served everyone a welcome cocktail upon arrival. The meal courses emphasized fish and foul. The main course was duck, in a rich brown sauce, and paired with a picked beet dish. They did an excellent job accommodating vegetarians and the couple of people who did not eat beef or pork. The food was very tasty, very much in the creative Copenhagen style of invented dishes with unusual ingredients (e.g., celery in salted caramel as part of a dessert). The wines were well matched with the food. As is common in Copenhagen, the server presents the course and matching wine/cocktail, in detail, at the beginning of each course. Portions are small, but there are many of them, and I was feeling quite full by course number six. There is access to an outdoor terrace on the 10th floor, and they allowed us breaks between some courses to step out for some fresh air (or a cigarette for those who smoke). I have been to a number of fine Copenhagen restaurants, some quite famous, such as Noma, Kadaeu, and Relae, and I would say that Trio is in the same league. You will pay Copenhagen prices for a meal at Trio. But for us, the experience was quite special.",5

He was also the waiter and busser. He never returned to ask if we wanted more drinks, dessert or coffee. It's obvious he pays more attention to regulars as we saw him take great care of a couple of other tables. We know it's customary to wait for the bill in Europe but we waited longer for the check than we did for the dinner and finally had to ask for it. If you don't mind this type of service, however, the food was fantastic. The tortellini is homemade and reminded me of eating in Venice. The garlic bread could be a meal by itself.

Deligreco,NielsTholstorf,"August 4, 2016",Disappointed,Had really been looking forward to this. Especially since the restaurant got a pretty great review in Danish newspaper Politiken the same day we visited. Very cosy place but really slow service and no information/ enthusiasm about the food. Ordered 7 tapas. 2 were nice. The rest rather disappointing. Had hoped for great calamari (which is a tough test for every Greek restaurant). But these were clearly over cooked and impossible to chew. Had to leave them with one of the other tapas which was kind of bland. Liked the Greek beer though. Maybe they just had a bad day and a fabulous day when the foodie visited. ,2

We were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation on a night with live Greek folklore music. Adding this to the already delicious food and the always smiling service, it was a wonderful night. Our server has always given great recommendations for food and then the perfect Greek wine to pair with it (in a very non-snobbish way). All around one of the best restaurants I've been to in Copenhagen. The only negative is that we cannot use an American credit card. Luckily there is an ATM very close by.",5

Good, traditional Greek dishes (stuffed calamari, Greek meatballs). Well prepared food. We had live music too and in total a very nice experience and we owe our thanks to the manager for finding us a table at the expense of the comfort of his party. This was not our last visit here!",5

The picnic-treat was just a massive disapointment. I could have bought it all in a convenience store. I did not see any authenticity, the servings were ordinary and I found the selection too poor.

Young waiting staff different each night, but friendly and helpful. We ate variously burgers, mussels, salads, steak, all tasty and well presented (the salmon salad was perhaps an exception, being rather disappointing).

Nothing had been cooked and prepared by a chef in the kitchen and everything you get is the cheapest quality of products. I wouldn't eat anything like that at home or even serve it to my kids.

It was very extensive with way more than we could sample, and we loved everything we did sample. Diners at other tables ordered from the menu and the portions were huge.

We ended up getting alcohol free beer, regular beer and two Italian style pizzas, that were delicious. Ended up paying approx. 52 euros. Without a doubt would visit this restaurant again, the food was amazing and of high quality. Highly recommend it!",5
Co-ma Bistro,mwv19,"July 4, 2018","Tasty food, big portions","We had a regular-sized pizza, a mini pizza, and a meat platter appetizer. It was very tasty.

Co-ma Bistro,Michal G,"September 10, 2017",Reasonable food and very central in Copenhagen,"In a culture where we tend to focus on lack of service, I have chosen to write constructive criticism of my enjoyable evening in Avenue Bistro and Wine Bar. I booked a table at 7:30 am for 4 people last night and was welcomed by a waitress who had introduced us to the menu and explained what suited best for our needs: 4 smaller portions and a pasta dish, as we were told not to be shared, yet it turned out to have to be shared between two people. We were served 2 pasta dishes for sharing between 4 people. It would be nice if this information was clear from the start avoiding to question waiters again to clarify a misunderstanding that they themselves had created. I was also called up by phone while we were seated in the restaurant because the waitresses had not told each other that I had arrived at my table reservation.

Nothing complicated in the food - a range of pastas, pizzas, risotto etc - but well-cooked, well-presented and served by lovely, attentive staff. Nice ambiance, too, candlelit and moody. A little on the expensive side, I'd say, but that might have more to do with the exchange rate than over-pricing! Recommended.",5

I had to ask the waiter what it was for. He looked at me like I was crazy and said that's how they are eaten in France. Having spent time in France, they probably do that because that is where we have had the worse french fries ever. These at Avenue do not need any mayonnaise. Go to this restaurant.

The chicken was probably the best I've had in a restaurant, cooked just perfectly. It's served with a Bernaise sauce that I didn't even use, as the chicken was so good on its own.

Its a really nice setting and the staff were friendly. However, in a pretty empty restaurant, we were seated on the same table as another couple which was a bit weird. I made the mistake of ordering the Danish 'special' which has no description but turns out to be a kind of sloppy burger in a pool of sauce (soggy bun, yuk). The other burger my sister ordered was just a tasteless hunk of 'meat'. The aioli fries are fries coated in eye-watering garlic salt, and the herb fries are fries with some dried mixed herbs chucked over the top.

The beef was juicy and cooked excellently (mine was medium), while the chicken burger was also very tasty. We accompanied them with fries and dips, though there are other choices for sides. While waiting for our food to get ready (approximately 15min), we had a chance to see how the restaurant itself was run. The atmosphere is nice and the crowd youthful and energetic, though it can get a tad noisy. The staff is very helpful and fluent in english, so there is no language barrier.

Problem lies with the fried noodle. It was watery, more like boiled noodle with egg and beef plus veggies. The problem with watery noodle is, when you don't cook the egg correctly, and you have carbon steel wok to cook with, you have the combination of fishy and steely taste and odor.

Try their crunchy pork with vegetable, the seafood soup in a hot pot (enough for 5-6 people) and the ""nam bok"" (spicy slices of beef).

Like everything else in Copenhagen it was relatively pricey but considering that I wouldn't recommend this place.

Wok On,camden95,"August 8, 2017",Fantastic value food near Nyhavn!,"A friend and I stumbled across Wok On when looking for somewhere cheap to eat near Nyhavn. Although the restaurants on the waterfront looked very nice, we decided they generally all charged a bit more than we wanted to spend on dinner (most mains there started at around 120kr., and many were closer to 200kr.). Copenhagen is a relatively expensive city, and finding somewhere 'cheap' to eat is a challenge, which is why we were delighted when we discovered Wok On on Gothersgade, just a little way beyond the end of Nyhavn. It's a fast food place (indeed, we ate here twice, and the meals, prepared as you wait, all arrived very fast!) that has a restaurant feel to it. Okay, it probably can't compete with the restaurants on Nyhavn in terms of atmosphere or people-watching capability, but given that a main at Wok On is around 45-70kr., we were certainly very impressed. The decor was all very pleasant and clean, and the service friendly and helpful. The food was delicious, and I am sure I will end up going back here if ever I am in Copenhagen again.",5

Wok On was just what we needed: distinctly more substantial than a sandwich, easy to understand and order and let us both get what we wanted. OK, one of us might have spoken more clearly and got precisely what they wanted but it was close enough (baby corn not cashews). Kept us going all afternoon and didn't break the bank.

The staff & ambience was still fantastic but the food was a bit of a letdown. Maybe it's because we went there at 20:00 which is kind of late for Denmark but the bun of the burger was not as soft, the beef patty was not as juicy and the fries were horrible to say the least.

The service was a little bit all over the place and we had to repeat our orders back when they came with the food to make sure we each got the dish we had ordered. I think, having been a server myself, it should not be so hard to remember or transmit who, out of just 4 guests, ordered what, to get it right in the first place and to avoid having guests swapping hot plates with each other. That said we had quite a lot of different staff waiting on us so that could be the reason.

Drinks are a tad expensive ($23.00 for a Kettle One martini), but then so is all of Copenhagen. The night i was there there were two bartenders and one waitress.

We were seated at the entrance near a door labeled “kitchen”, and we waited 20 minutes before anybody brought us a menu. When we finally got our meals, the steak filets were not cooked as ordered—they were well done (we ordered medium). Furthermore, the waiter insisted that we add a sauce (extra charge) and then he spilled it on the table and didn’t clean it.

MASH Penthouse,869Kelly,"February 10, 2018",Finest steak in Copenhagen ,"My wife and I were married in Denmark and made plans to eat here for a celebratory dinner. I grew up with cattle and am a self proclaimed steak snob. We split the Porterhouse for two and it was fantastic. The size is definitely enough for two people and while it didn't quite have the same rich flavor as the best in the US, it was incredibly tender and still delicious. We had a wonderful dinner, all of the side items and wine were also very good and our waitress was kind and attentive. I've always had a harder time finding truly good beef when in Europe and I have to say that this place delivered what they advertise, it was easily the best I've had over there.",5

It has a stunning view of the city of Copenhagen. Simply breathtaking! The menu is what you'd expect from any self respecting steakhouse. Lots of meat dishes, nice sides, etc. But, once you start to get into it you notice that there are some very special things on there. Like the starters. There are plenty of very nice dishes to start your evening. I especially recommend the Lobster Thermidor which is simply stunni ",5
MASH Penthouse,Katie7S,"January 28, 2018","Amazing food, lovely view, great service...","We decided to visit here whilst visiting Copenhagen, due to dining in Mash London a lot, and we weren't disappointed. We were sat on a lovely table by the window, and were served by a lovely waitress who's English was perfect. Our food came out in a reasonably quick time and we were not disappointed. We both had the Uruguay Flat Iron steak and it was delicious and cooked perfectly. We also had French fries and mushrooms which were both great too. We ordered garlic & thyme sauce, however, am 100% certain it was red wine sauce - even though we questioned it... It tasted strongly of red wine, and tasted exactly the same as the red wine sauce at London - and no taste of garlic/thyme whatsoever. We also found that although Mash isn't particularly cheap, the portion of mushrooms was just enough for one person... We were quite surprised considering the price, and having a very very small portion. But the food was delicious. Wine was fantastic. View was lovely. And wonderful service. Would definitely return!

I must say that it was fancy and felt like one of those restaurants where the money that you pay for does not justify the quality of food served. I would rate this restaurant pretty high in terms of location, service and staff. However where we were left wanting for more was the flavour of the steak, it wasn't up to the mark for that price point. Practical info: Always better to reserve a table at this place, and be ready to shell out anywhere in the proximity of 700 krones for a couple dinner",4

MASH Penthouse,Jaymack208,"September 18, 2016",One of the best steaks I have personally eaten anywhere.,"WOW! what an experience in a great location overlooking Copenhagen and to top it off a great memory of our 10th wedding anniversary. I had some trepidation going to this restaurant but by the end of the evening I wondered why I had these concerns and admittedly most of my nerves were gleaned from previous Trip Advisor reviews. The staff were excellent, professional and friendly paired with the knowledge about the food they serve. This was evident when my wife stated that she likes the fillet cut of steak which turned out they do not serve, however, she was recommended a good alternative by the waiter. When subsequently asked how she liked it cooked she stated well done with no blood to which he then recommended that she shouldn't take his original suggestion as it would make it very dry but instead offered another alternative that could be cooked to her liking and would sill retain flavour and moisture. I haven't experienced this anywhere before and true to his word the steak turned out the way she liked it. The setting itself is way up on the 12th floor of the Tivoli conference center and although it is dimly lit this, for me, adds to the experience and after a while you do acclimatise to it and, unlike other reviewers, wasn't a massive issue. There is a great choice of wines along with a few beers as well. My only negative comment though would be the lack of starters and this is more about our personal tastes rather than choice and quality of food. My wife and I aren't overly adventurous when it comes to going out of our comfort zones and therefore all but one of the starters weren't to our ""personal"" tastes and it would have been nice having some other simpler options. In terms of value for money it has to be about right considering the fact for one it's in Copenhagen and two bearing in mind the quality of all ingredients added to the location, ambiance and staff. I will make a point of visiting this place again and even to the point of making a reservation in London. ",4

We got a small tasting to start. Then we shared garlic soup, sea bass with caponata and chicken tikka masala with rice. The food was good, perhaps the chicken was the best for us. The caponata was over flavouring the fish and was a bit too salty. The soup was ok, but not really a tasty dish, very light. The rice had different flavours, good. Prices according to the area. ",4

The food, when it came, was the best I've had in ages! I actually took my eyes off the book and just savored the many flavors. Not long, I mean, the book was a Clare Mackintosh thriller after all.

With each dish or tapa you taste all the different tastes of the various ingredients, spices, and herbs rather than just one dominant taste - and delicious combinations of tastes they were! Divine! The food is also beautifully displayed on the plates with great care. The ambiance is very nice. Nice wooden tables. As decoration there are glass pots with submersed orchids. I met three different staff, and they each had memorable personalities. The first was a very attractive and attentive man, giving me the feeling I was special. The second was honest enough to recommend that today I should not eat the scallops, and later made up for a small mistake by giving me rice with red curry for free and a bit more wine than usual, without even mentioning it. The third was a delightful cheerful singing Russian young lady who treated me the second time as a good old friend and cheered with me that today the scallops were good. These people were very pleasant. But the best of the whole event was the divine experience to the taste buds. What a choice of ingredients!",5

They ensured it was a mistake but over a month later i am still to receive my refund. They’re customer service is beyond awful and the food is nothing to write home about.

Yes, the food was good, often excellent, but the service was the worst we've ever encountered. The restaurant had a special New Year's Eve menu on their website, but neither of the two waiters knew about it, so we had to settle for the regular menu. On top of that, one of them was new (on New Year's Eve!), didn't know anything at all about any of the dishes on the menu, and actually asked us whether we wanted her to ask the kitchen (when her reply obviously should've been: ""I don't know – I'll ask the kitchen""). As for the more experienced waiter, he: a) brought us sparkling water when we asked for still, b) had to be reminded to take the sparkling water away again, c) brought us our main courses before we had finished our starters, d) had to be reminded to take our starter plates away to make room, e) told us the two desserts were ""the same"" even though the ""house dessert"" turned out to be a ""moelleux"" (molten chocolate cake) with ice cream while the other one was a ""gateau marcel"" (mousse chocolate cake) with ice cream, and f) told us that the ice cream was ""probably vanilla"", after which he forgot to check with the kitchen and left us with a ""just taste it and be surprised"" (we were because it turned out to be coconut). Finally, the two waiters didn't seem to know how the tables were split between them, so they both asked us if we were ready to order. Yes, the food was really good (especially the teriyaki beef with cream cheese, the chicken sticks with peanut sauce, and the massaman curry), but the service was so bad that we cannot justify a higher rating or another visit.",2

We picked it because it was near our hotel and were surprised by the quality and generous portion of Masaman curry. We also ordered a tapas style appetizer plate. That was enough for three of us so we ended up satisfied and happy with the price as two dishes filled us up. The vibe is cool as are most restos in this former meat packing area of town. Much prefer this kind of atmosphere to the mainstay touristy Hard Rock Cafe type bits in this town of uber pricey meals. We are from Los Angels USA and are used to paying a bit for good restaurant experiences but Copenhagen is crazy expensive no matter where u eat so that is why we were pleased by this meal.

My Pad Thai was light on prawns, tofu and egg and heavy on the noodles. Could have been a little spicier too. OK if you're in the neighbourhood but not worth a trip across town. ",3

The restaurant was not that busy and we had to return the white wine as it was way too warm.. even before the food finally arrived. The waiter explained that the wine fridge was broken, and replaced the bottle with another half emptied bottle he found in another fridge (!). When the dishes (that btw looked pretty funny like ""splashed drops of plastic"") finally arrived the food was almost ice cold. As I was on a date.. I didn't feel like making a fuzz about it... but I'd rather pay half the price for a similar takeaway order (which CAN be obtained elswhere.. anywhere) than double the price for a lukewarm experience... 3 stars for interior, nice seating, relatively fast order/payment handling and for avodance of stomack pains.

The waitress spoke excellent English. I agree that the spring rolls weren't that over the top, but that's only because the other two dishes we had were very tasty and again, visually very appealing.

We had two kinds of salami, a roasted artichoke, nice onion rings with a garlic-y mayonnaise, a bit of fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, and crostini of two different types. Not a miss in the bunch. Then they brought us a creamy cabbage soup with scallops and something delicious and crispy mixed in (fried pancetta maybe). Again, excellent; the soup alone would have been very tasty, but the crispy surprise in every bite, smokey and nice but not overpowering was a particularly nice touch. Then one of us got cod, with crispy fried veggies and a caper based sauce, while the other tried the pork cheeks, braised in a rich brown sauce served over polenta. Also really good. The dessert was not quite up the to same standard, a bowl of crunchy, creamy chocolate almond stuff, but good too. They have a narrow set of wines, drinks and beers, but its a good set.

Vespa,CJF897,"June 4, 2013",An unexpected delight in the heart of Copenhagen,"The approach is simple and relaxing: one menu with a choice between meat and fish on the main course, Manzo and Branzino in our case. The food was very tasty, contemporary Italian. We had a range of antipasti to start, followed by pasta with asparagus, then the main course. Dessert was also a delight. The house red (was it really ""all you can drink""?) suited the food, the white was a little tart for my taste. Since I was invited, I can't saw too much about the price, except that my Danish host was pleasantly surprised. Well worth another visit during my next in Copenhagen.",5

The 10 small antipastis were very good, followed by a soup and secondi piatti which was tender meat with vegetables. I would personally prefer a pasta as primera piatti insteda of a soup as it feels more italian, but the soup was tasty. Italian ice cream as dessert was so delicious! Best in a very long time.

Initially we were the only customers in this part of the pub. Service could have been quicker but once we were noticed we were served fairly quickly. We had some hot chocolates and an Irish coffee. These were of average quality but very welcome on such a cold wet day. Nyhavn seems to have many places where you can eat and drink completely outside or complete inside and we liked the compromise of sitting almost inside but with a decent view outside. Food and service pretty average but the half-outside area served our needs well on this particular day so worth a higher rating for that reason alone.",4

Contrary to the non-Danish name, they serve wonderful smørrebrød sandwiches served on rugbrød (traditional rye bread) and a great Danish beer. Price for three sandwiches and three beverages was about $60 - prices are a bit higher in this city. We ate outside and had a good time people-watching. If you want lunch, go earlier, because by early/mid afternoon, the entire street along the canal is packed with people. Service was good (we had a lovely waitress from Canada!) and the food was delicious.

McJoy's Choice,derekw23,"December 16, 2014",Sunday lunch on my own!,After shopping I went in here as it was described as Copenhagens first gastro pub and it was Scottish. To be fair it couldn't really be further away from a Scottish bar if it tried - I am from Aberdeen originally! It had a friendly tourist feel to it and there were some Scottish folk in their. Didn't have lemonade. No fresh orange and lemonade. The roast beef sandwich was Danish by definition with Rye bread - only one piece and lots of meat. It was lovely and I ate the lot and so was likely better than the usual Scottish pub sandwich but it wasn't scottish. It had a cosy atmosphere on a cold Dec day and was busy due to its location.

I had the traditional Danish pork dish and my wife the cod cakes and the main meals were both very well presented and nice on the palate. Like many eateries though in Copenhagen, their pricing is just too expensive for a standard meal in a standard restaurant.

It was delicious, except from the caviar which I don't like overall. It was a really filling and tasty dish. My partner had the lobster soup. I had a taste and that was really nice too.

The bar staff working that evening were expats and they were friendly enough. Be careful when you order beer (Hoegaarden in particular) - they will serve it in a huge glass unless you specify otherwise - not the best example of good customer service. As with most places in Copenhagen, it is possible to settle your bill with a credit card.

It's a combination between an old school Danish inn and a grill bar. Smoking is allowed inside. The service is great, and so is the food, if you like it the traditional Danish way.

When we realised they didn't come with fries, we ordered a separate portion which were fresh and hot and very nice. However I can't say the same about the fajitas which were warmed up and definitely not fresh or sizzling!!? Half of the dish was cold as were the tortilla wraps. My friend ordered English tea but they only had Earl Grey, which came as a teabag, with a separate small pot, half filled with boiled water?! We didn't see our server again so weren't asked if we were OK or if we were happy with the food. I had to ask another server who got our original waitress, who then came over an told us that she was going home and had already worked over her time. We told her our complaint and she asked the manager to come and have a chat with us. He came over and listened to our concerns, he seemed grateful for our feedback and did offer us an explanation, but to be honest it felt like he was trying to justify the problems. He did give us 50% off our bill, and rightly so. After eating in a few different Hard Rock cafes, and always enjoying fantastic food, we wouldn't recommend Hard Rock Copenhagen. We were extremely disappointed and the food is very overpriced. ",2

However my issue was the server (her name was Marissa or something similar) approached our table whilst we were eating our starter telling us our mains were coming - I asked her to delay this as we weren’t finished and felt we needed a break after the starter - her response was ‘it’ll be ready any minute now so no’ - I don’t think this is the attitude to have towards paying customers! Our burgers then came whilst we were still eating our starters, put on the table whilst our plate hadn’t been cleared - our burgers then sat there until we felt ready to continue eating by which point they were cold. Her attitude ruined my experience and after we had this discussion she became very hostile with us - not happy - this young lady needs a lesson in customer service ",3

We were seated upstairs in the front room – not really appealing. Limited seating here and all you see is server traffic to the kitchen which is right there. Apparently the primary dining areas is in the back of the building, which you can not see from where were seated. They do not serve food on the first floor where the bar is. I would suggest you ask for a table in the main dining area – probably a better ambiance and better contact with your server",3

Hard Rock Cafe,Trippermaya,"June 22, 2017",Horrible one-time experience,"I was at Hard Rock Cafe with 7 friends, and we arrived at about 18.30. We ordered 4 caesar salads, one portion of nachos (because I am vegetarian, and the only other options were either a big and expensive burger or a side dish) and 3 burgers. And for drinks we ordered 3 pepsi's and 5 ""cocktails"". However, it is important to add, that the menu card said that the cocktails were 75 dkk INCLUDING 5 cocktail glasses, which we could take home afterwards. We waited about 1,5 hours for our food. The burgers were VERY well done (almost black) and the chicken was extremely dry. The bathroom hygiene was also very poor, and our waitress, although very kind, had a hard time answering our questions and only spoke English. We recieved our bill and were amused by how expensive our food had been, despite it being of quite bad quality. We then noticed that on top of our regular meal expences, the bill also read ""retail: 210 dkk"", so we were slightly confused and asked our waitress, who told us that it was merely to ""break it down"", and that the 210 dkk were for our 5 cocktails but that they were not added to our final expences. We then went to the shop to get our glasses, but were then told that we had to pay 210 dkk extra (42 dkk per glass) on top of the 75 dkk per glass that we had already paid. And they added that we could not choose to not pay for the glasses that we didn't even want. So now we have 5 extremely overprised plastic cups to remind us of this very disapointing experience. I find this so sad, as many of us have had amazing experiences with Hard Rock Cafe's abroad, but for some reason, the one in Copenhagen unfortunately didn't meet that standard.",1

With that, we thought booking a meal at Hard Rock would be a great way to celebrate on the day, as we usually love going as a special treat. However, the service was absolutely appalling. I ordered a burger, and my boyfriend ordered the steak. I asked for my burger to be well-done (as the waitress gave me the option) and it came pink, cold, and inedible. They also forgot extra bits and bobs off the steak too. Both of which may have been excused, as I understand accidents happen, had the service been good + an apology. However, our waitress seemed (constantly) preoccupied by laughing with fellow co-workers at the kitchen pass, and just had an awful attitude. We were at the verge of leaving mid-meal, neither of us enjoyed the food. Then, to top it off, a stag do (as you can imagine), drunk beyond belief stood near our table, swaying into us, shouting all over the dining area. No-one asked them to behave respectably, especially as there lots of children around. Overall, the food and service were terrible, and yet the prices are still ridiculously high!",1

Could not ask for a better service! Then Joan the manager from Barcelona had a chat with us. He was impressed with how many we had been to and said he would put a song on for me. Bohemian Rhapsody of course! Eating good food and listening to queen what could be better! If booked in advance as a deal the prices are very reasonably.

Hard Rock Cafe,hannahdavidson88,"December 18, 2016",Terrible Experience,"My sister and I have just returned from our holiday in Copenhagen and though we had a wonderful time there, we had a terrible evening in the Hard Rock Cafe. We went in for a couple of drinks on our last night in the city, Thursday the 15th, and as soon as we sat down we realised the two men dancing by the table next to us had been served far too much alcohol and could barely stand. They then continued to persist in asking us to dance with them though we had politely declined. We decided because of this we were going to move on and as my sister visited the restroom before we planned to leave she slipped on a pile of a customer’s vomit. Now, perhaps the vomit had not been reported to staff and they were unaware it was there which is perfectly understandable. However, they offered no apology to my sister, were point blank rude to her when she complained and no manager came to speak to us to offer and apology or to help my sister clean her clothes which were covered in someone else’s vomit. When we asked to speak to the manager to make a formal complaint about the service we were told ""that they couldn’t find her"". As a member of the service industry myself I was appalled in the way in which they treated us, were extremely rude to us and treated our legitimate complaint as an inconvenien ",1

The old Hard Rock Cafe in Copenhagen felt like a proper Hard Rock Cafe. Since moving it to the new location the feel has changed. Now it feels like a fast food restaurant like any McDonalds but with better food. They have completely lost the atmosphere. Part of the problem was the lighting. It was really bright in there. The tables and chairs were not the normal Hard Rock Cafe furniture but felt more like office furniture. No booths to sit in like at most other Hard Rocks. Also, the lay out of the restaurant was not great. They have the tables spread out in lots of smaller spaces and we got stuck on a table just outside the kitchen.

Hard Rock Cafe,Nataliano,"June 19, 2016","Worst mojito ever, burger ok","So I've never been to a Hard Rock Cafe , I will not be back. To start told a long wait for a table for 2. This wait lasted just as long as we paid for 2 drinks , to go upstairs to a half full restaurant. Already a bit of a scam . Mojito bought in the bar was basically cheap sugar, lime on top , a smudge of rum and water to top up. Absolutely rank. The waiter was nice enough but we ordered 2 burgers a veg one and a special one. Veggie one was ok, nothing special. The Giardino Chicago burgers was a poor replica of the meaty party shown on the pictures. Coupled with a bottle of cheap plonk was a lot of money for a mediocre burger and absolute lack of atmosphere. Pretty grim, basically TGI Fridays with better marketing and no better quality actually ashamed to say I went in. Would rather support local custom and was glad to be proven right. Avoid if possible ",3

On time, we were taken upstairs and seated and our waitress introduced herself and gave us the menus. Laila was being supervised, as it was her first time doing the waitress role, and she was very good. The food is the same the world over, so it is the service you are commenting on, and it was good throughout. My only problem with this particular one, is the dining room was very warm.

Copenhagen is notorious for its un subtle racism, uniquely because of the current situations with refugees therefore anyone 'asian' is looked down upon. On walking into hard rock cafe we were left waiting fro 15 mins to be seated..being the first to come in. Oddly a danish family came in after us and the female staff member who came down to seat us..informed us that the danish family had been waiting before us...when we pointed out the fact this wasn;t the actual fact..she ignored us and served us after them, Quite disgusting to be honest..overall expensive food next to that..but good quality nice burgers and nice cocktails..the waiter who served us was much better and polite I believe his name was Simon...overall sad to see some low minded staff but the food/service of our waiter rescued this review..",3

Hard Rock Cafe,stephaniet336,"April 9, 2016",So disappointed,My two daughters love Hard Rock Cafe so it was their choice to eat here. We hadn't booked so we were told we would have a half an hour wait for a table but we were pleased to only wait twenty minutes. We ordered our food but after about 45 minutes when everyone else seemed to be getting their food the waiter came up to say he had forgotten to put our order through. So we waited over an hour to eat. My chicken was terrible although everyone else loved theirs. You could clearly see that I had left most of my meal but the waiter never asked if anything was wrong or if he could replace it he just took it away. When the bill came up we were charged the full amount so we had to complain about the long wait and eventually after talking to his manager they took something off the bill. Have always had amazing service at HRC in the USA but so disappointed with this one.,2

Our table is located with a window view of Tivoli. If you are not into American menu and desires savouring Nordic food, skip this. Bought a set of 4 Copenhagen city shot glasses at DKK 190.",4
Hard Rock Cafe,Rob N,"December 26, 2015",Great place,So...it's like most Hard Rocks but I'll say this one was packed. If you are needing a fast meal...prepare for a crowd. Once you're in and seated...the food is great as was the wait staff.,4

I didn't want to figure out a menu in a foreign land or try to see if the place I picked was actually a good restaurant. Hence, I picked Hard Rock. I knew what was on the menu (US food) and everyone would speak English. This place did not disappoint. Good service, great burger and music videos like they used to have. You want a reliable meal and know what your getting this is the place. Just a short walk from Tivoli. No Danish experience here. Just good old American bar food. That's what I wanted.

Hard Rock Cafe,MrsTpd,"October 17, 2015",Disappointing Visit,"We arrived for lunch and although the restaurant wasn't very busy we had a 10 minute wait for a table. We were seated upstairs and were greeted quickly by our server but the service really left a lot to be desired. Our soft drinks took about 25 minutes to arrive, but our starters never arrived at all. However we did receive refills on our drinks and a few promises that our food was ""on it's way"" - not sure where from though as it took more than an hour after ordering! We were on vacation, so didn't make a fuss, but things just got stranger and stranger. Our server was quite rude and argumentative towards another family at a nearby table and other diners could overhear their conversation, then she approached another table and was all friendly like nothing had just happened. Finally after almost an hour and a half, our main courses arrived, which were tasty and were decent sized portions. We waited quite a while for any servers to be back in our area, and when ours finally appeared she just said ""here's your bill"" and never even asked if we wanted desserts and/or coffees! She disappeared again for another 10 minutes or so (we caught her chatting to another worker just out of sight of the main dining area when we visited the toilets) before she came back around to collect payment, smiled sweetly and said goodbye! This was definitely the weirdest experience we've had at any HRC we've visited, but we've decided to class this as a one off. If we're ever back in Copenhagen, we wouldn't bother returning to HRC unfortunately.",3

Whilst walking around we ran into the Hard Rock Cafe it was almost an unbeatable discovery. Not knowing the quality we decided to give it a try. instantly when we walked in speedy service to dinning in? Or a causal drink at the bar. We decided to go up stairs for a nice quiet but lively meal. As we got up there we had menus and asked for our drinks straight away we weren't ready to order but had plenty of people checking up on us. When we got our drinks and meal ordered it all felt smooth. When the food had came out it was big portions and very tasty. The waitress continued to check up on us even when we were finished in total it was about 555dkk for two but we had gotten souvenir classes and two bigger beverages. Also for dinner like that more than worth it. Reason for the four stars is it has to really blow my mind to be a 5 star but I recommended it!,4

Order arrived pretty fast but what I got was nothing like the Hard Rock nachos I am used to getting.

We ate upstairs in what looked a bit like a Mcdonalds. It was too well lit and the music too poppy which made you think you weren't in a Hard Rock at all. Also only one screen for the whole area so many people had their backs to it. Even our 18 yr old daughter thought it was wrong!

The dessert were brought out to us in 4d form for us to choose from and I have to say i was beaten by the apple cobbler i just couldn't finish it even tho it was divine it was huge. the fudge brownies went down a treat also.

Gorm's Nyhavn,Nigel W,"July 28, 2020",Under-impressed,We had tried their pizzas on a previous visit to Copenhagen - delivered to where we were staying by Wolt - they were delicious and innovative. So we decided to try one of the company's restaurants. An unmemorable experience. We waited absolutely ages to have our main course served. It looked like the takeaway service took priority over the restaurant service. The pizza was good. My partner liked his veal. We took a 3-course set menu + wine menu. The wine menu was a total rip-off - DKK 150 for 2 meagre glasses of characterless white wine. There is also something rather gloomy and drab about the cellar premises. Not an exciting experience. A one-off.,3

The restaurant was only half full and we were sitting at a table with full view of the kitchen. We placed our order for 2 pizzas at 18.30. We sat waiting without any bread or any attention from the staff. After half an hour I asked where our pizzas were they said they were busy, but we could see that the kitchen staff wasn't working that hard. 15 minutes later they serve a couple that came to the restaurant 10 minutes after us. I then ask again were our pizzas were and why other tables got served before us. I was then told our pizzas were soon to be made. We waited for over 45 minutes and when the pizzas arrived they were very dry and not much toppings on them. Neither the taste, quality and size would justify the very high prices they charge. The lack of service and the long wait makes this a terrible tourist trap and the absolute worst pizza experience in Copenhagen. No compensation for the experience was offered. A true over priced tourist trap.",1

They were all looking a bit confused, but hey ho. The waiter who was on his own, eventually came over to us with two blue menu's which he said we could choose snacks from and drinks and he would return with the food menu. OK. Then the wait happened. The waiter was dithering all over the place (we wondered if it was his first day). Another couple sat at the table next to us, and he eventually came over and delivered the blue menu and the same speech. While he was there I asked if we could order some drinks (this was about 10 minutes in). Yes, I'll be right back. Nope, the dithering reappeared. The new couple next to us asked did we have to wait long to get served. Oh yes. We managed to order the drinks which took another 10 minutes to arrive, in the meantime the couple got up and walked out. The waiter was oblivious to this.

The prices are about right for Copenhagen. ,5

There were families with kids waiting someting like 40 - 50 minutes for warm food, all people hungry and tired of it. But we were pretty aware that there was something going on in the kitchen, unfortunately not our pizzas. Definitely they had some outside orders, we could smell it, but still they let people order without telling them that they would wait a long time. When it comes to food that time we both got sick after pizzas! It was veggie, white pizzas with potatos and goat chees, but I could taste that they mixed goat cheese with some other kind instead. And the really bad thing about that place is that it happened the evening when the owner was at the place, leaving his customers with such a poor service. That was enough for us. Never again.

I originally ordered one that had potato on it, but I must confess I didn't like it as the slices of potato weren't very well cooked and it seemed dry. My daughter kindly swapped and said she quite liked it. There was only one waitress on that night - she said someone else had phoned in sick - and she was clearly struggling as we had to wait quite a while to be served. She was very apologetic though...Also, the floor down by the loos was extremely sticky and it smelled bad down there...If I'd gone down there before eating I wouldn't have wanted to stay! However, we did have a good night...but when my daughters and I get together we generally do, regardless of where we are! It's not cheap and seems to run on the fact that a Danish TV chef owns it...hence the piles of his books lying around. I don't think I'd go there again.",2

We were originally offered an English menu but ended up being given a Danish one. OK because we had a Danish-speaking person in our group but it did lead to a bit of confusion which was my fault because I then tried to order the things I wanted in Danish and it led to several crossed wires! I thought I was getting a pizza with jerusalem artichokes and foie gras. It didn't seem to have either. I thought I'd been given the wrong thing but I asked a waitress who confirmed it was correct. My friend wanted me to eat it anyway (it was their second attempt at trying to bring the right meal, and he'd misunderstood the drink I wanted due to my failed linguistic attempt), so I ate it, but to be fair, if you are paying £17 for a pizza which doesn't have those gourmet ingredients on, they should lower the price. My friend also thought she was getting some artichokes I think but she said it was a brussel sprout! Maybe they should be honest if they have run out of ingredients instead of pretending you won't notice. The waiter offered us a free hot drink for the original mistake and was really apologetic about it, but unfortunately I ordered a mint tea which was hideous! So if you order well, and money is no object, I think it can be a good place.",3

The menu fulfilled our expectations. One problem we discovered was that they are located inside of Tivoli Gardens. We had to pay an admission fee to get in which is not refundable. The space was hard to find because park personnel did not give good directions but we did locate Gemyse after about 20 minutes. M. The space is simple. There is a decent bar with wine, cocktails and beer. The food was some of the best we have had in Copenhagen. The beetroot falafel was delicious. We almost ordered a second helping. The cod starter, BBQ cauliflower entree and the beetroot patte were all fantastic. Service was good as well and they were not crowded at all so dinner was quiet and relaxed. I would save this place for an evening when you can enjoy the rides in the park as well as dinner. ",4
Gemyse,Paul H,"October 10, 2019","Such a poor experience, never again","We had a group and thankfully we had a private room. The food was underwhelming. The main course was a real disappointment, actually, I felt insulting in its lack of imagination. With all the wonderful choice of vegetables available the complete meal lacked imagination and in all honesty flari. The dessert a chocolate gateau turned out to be a mousse and was ULTRA sweet. The really good dessert wine was utterly lost and overwhelmed by this dessert. The fact you could taste the crystals of sugar was really not good. We demolished so much bread, in a meal that was, for me, totally dissatisfying. I have enjoyed so much better. The promise of organic vegetables with plenty of taste and texture maybe. precision-cooked vegetables offering poor serving – and as for their promises you a plate full of intense taste certainly had that for a mega-sweet gateau-mousse - the meal did not live up to the hype, or I suspect the price.",2

The welcoming champaign, friendly service, and the almost artistic starter plate (flower looking veggie dumblings) accompanied with good white wine, were promising a vegetarian gourmet feast. Unfortunately the following portions were like from a different kitchen. Broccolinis and kimchi, rough and mediocre. The main course consisting of overcooked, sad leaks accompanied with almost raw napa cabbage halves (!) and cooked potatoes. Ugly and almost tasteless. Definitely not up to any Michelin or other fine-dining standards. The dessert ice cream was delicious, but could not rescue this pointlessly expensive dinner.",3

But, like indifferent Catalan Botifarra, the insides failed to live up to it and the food and drink were predictable and average. The tapas was pretty poor and not cheap - the meatballs, for example, were actually just 4 slices of what appeared to be a mostly flavourless meatloaf in a generic tomato sauce. The cava was warm and beer nothing special. Not a great evening and one not helped by rather disinterested service, at best. Perhaps Saturday evening is not their preferred time to be serving clients, but we had to seek chocolate and ice cream straight after to recover! Some other reviewers seem to love this place (hence our visit) and it could easily be really rather good, but a lot of attention to food detail and clientele themselves is needed for this to happen. There's a tapas bar (Ultra Comeda) in far flung Aberystwyth (look it up on a map!!!) which proves it can be done and done to a stunningly Spanish level.",2

Very cheap and uncomfortable stools at the bar, but as I was alone, I did not want to take up a table for 2. Pleasant waiter behind the bar, recommended several numbers of Dimsum as favorites. Had WonTon soup, which was excellent. Steamed #5 Ha Gau - Shrimp & veggies, Crispy #19 Gaozi and the Vegetarian #28 Crispy Cantonese Chive Pancake. All the Dimsum were well made and mildly flavorful, The ONLY condiment offered (and he did not offer it I saw it on the corner of the counter) was Sriracha Chili Sauce,(from Califiornia) I don't know how that is authentic Dim Sum. I could have really enjoyed some other sauces as the DimSum was quite bland, I am not dropping my rating on this because I believe the Dimsum was quite authentic.

When I entered the restaurant, I was stopped by the manager, asking me where I was going, I said to the Ladies, he said the toilets were only for customers and I explained we had just finished eating at a table outside. The manager hesitated, he seemed not to believe me, so I asked if I could use the toilet again at which point he blocked my way and said he didn't like my attitude! I was completely confused. He said it was best I uses toilets elsewhere. I said surely I had a right to use their toilets. He said now and when I queried this was told "" This is Denmark , we can do what we like""! I got very upset, my boyfriend entered and it turned out he has said the same thing to my boyfriend, but when my boyfriend explained he had a table outside, the manager had let him use the toilets.

Would’ve been ok if they had said something when we ordered, then we would’ve known to expect it, but the waiter said nothing. When we got our bill and asked “isn’t tap water free?” the waiter took immediate offence, saying that we’d sat at the table for the past hour, and had to pay for that (that’s correct - eating the 6 smørrebrød we had ordered and happy to pay for). I think they could’ve answered our query much more politely, rather than getting so defensive straight away. It’s fine if this is a charge all over Copenhagen - but take the time to explain that to your customers - specially when you know they are tourists.

Brooklyn Bar Koebenhavn,richardcN1899II,"March 23, 2017",Delicious Danish Dining ,We had just been to watch the Changing of the Guard and were in need of lunch - just spotted this place and went inside - so glad we did. We now feel that we have had an authentic Danish dining experience. We left the choice of everything to the very friendly waiter. We started with 3 types of herring followed by 3 types of smørrebrød each. All the food was delicious but proved too much for us but it was no problem for them to provide a 'doggy' bag. Also recommended was a Jacobson Blonde beer (that we had seen being brewed at the Carlsberg brewery the day before) and an Aquavit that both accompanied the food perfectly. Fantastic!,5

We had got so cold and hungry we just had to find somewhere to eat and warm up quickly. Our waitress was really friendly and we were served pretty quickly. We had the Frikadeller Smørrebrød (Danish meatball open sandwich) which was delicious. The coffee was really good and so was the hot chocolate.,5

The wc was absolutely scrawled with graffiti. And when we collected our (half full) coffee cups, the waiter bluntly asked for 90k (£9!!!). I've never paid £4.50 for a plain americano in my life, even in the most extortionate places. We felt well and truly mugged off. Avoid at all costs. ",1

But I can imagine that the herring is maybe not a tourist favorite. So if you want herring or something like that you probably need to specified that. The service was fine. The beer was actually not very good, but that is of course my taste. But all in all, a very nice place to eat lunch. And if you want a dessert ""Vaffelbageren"" is just across the street.",4

Brooklyn Bar Koebenhavn,Mamiya7,"July 12, 2015",A pleasant place for lunch--a little less zany than nearby,This place became very full for lunch after we were seated. It is not a large place. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I had an open-faced brisket sandwich with a local dark ale that was on tap. My wife had fish. This was our first meal in Copenhagen and it was a bit of stick shock for a pint of ale to be over $10 USD and a cappuccino to be about $7 USD. This was about double what we were paying in Belgium. It is a little more sane here than the activity on nearby Nyhavn Street.,4

I had calamari to start and whilst they and the accompanying dip tasted ok they were coated in a quite dark crust as opposed to a golden colour.

Saturday evening, we managed to get a table without a reservation. After 10 minutes of being seated, i went to ask for the menu’s. We then flagged down another waiter and asked if we could order some drinks. When a waiter finally turned up, we ordered some small dishes. The waiter informed us it was his first night, so he couldn’t recommend anything. Pizza, meatballs, calamari and olives. Wasn’t impressed with anything that was delivered. The waiter managed to mess up our order, which meant we had to wait for dishes, which was not good. The restaurant was full, but the food was bland.

So we got a table around 7 o'clock in this corner place right by the entrance, bought drinks and were just having a good time. Around 9:30 PM this guy from the wardrobe tells us that he has to take our table away because he needs to use it for the wardrobe which didn't make any sense. Why leave that table open for people if later on, you claim that it's unavailable? He said we could keep our chairs so we just sat in the same spot until later on, one of the bouncers came over and threw us out because ''it was too packed'', ''there are too many people'' and ''we were in the way of the people'' whatever that means. Fist of all, we weren't in the way of anyone because YOU PLACED A TABLE THERE, therefore, we sat on it. Second, why on Earth would you treat your clients this way when they have chosen to come and spend their money in your bar? Have you heard of customer service?? I understand bouncers are horrible sometimes because they deal with drunk people and so on, but we were neither drunk or in the way of anyone, we were just trying to enjoy our night out, which your bouncer managed to spoil. In all my J-dag nights out I have never experienced this. If you thought your bar was too packed then why let more people in, instead of throwing people out from the inside? That's what every normal venue with good management would do. I will make sure that none of my friends ever spend their money at your bar.",1

I can’t really comment of the quality if the food because my wife and I only had chips and garlic bread, which were passable at best. It’s the quality of the pint of Guinness which I take exception to. After enduring about half of it, and notwithstanding the high price of said pint, I decided for my stomach’s sake that I would leave the rest of it. The ironic thing about Guinness these days is that there is no good reason why the standard should not be the same in Dublin as experienced throughout the rest of Europe. The keg can be delivered in about the same time as would take to Dingle in County Kerry. If it doesn’t taste the same, then that has to be down to bad management of the pipes, etc. On reflection, maybe it’s just as well we didn’t go for the full meal.",1

We were given a table with used glasses from the previous client. After a long time a young girl came and asked us what we would want to eat and drink. We asked for a glass of wine and for a menu. We got our wine, but waited for a very long time and asked several times to have our dirty table cleaned. After a while the dirty glasses were removed and we ordered a salmon sandwich. It was served after more than half an hour, and at that time the last sun of the day was away and it was being cold.

The Dubliner,SkiingCyclingDave,"July 22, 2014",Drink but don't eat,The location of this pub on Stroget is great for people watching and having a drink in between bouts of sightseeing and shopping. We had a nice beer but 2 of the 3 meals were below standard. The Beef in the Beef and Guinness Pie was rather tough and had lumps of fat on it. Maybe some like It that way but I prefer mine lean. And the beef burger was very tough. The worst meal out we've had in a long time as we did not finish it. Only the salmon appetizer reached average quality. There is nice outdoor seating and when we were there it was hot so the large interior was empty. The server was very friendly. So my recommendation would be to just sit and drink at this location.,2

The chips were OK but I didn't care for the mustard salad dressing. It is not an inexpensive restaurant (approximately $90 USD for 3 meals, 2 beers & 1 Coke) but that seems typical for Copenhagen.

The restaurant is located under the Astoria Hotel not far from Copenhagen central station. It’s not the flashiest place, but it was clean and it kept us out of the cold and rain. We came in through the Vesterbrogade entrance and were welcomed by the waitress. There was four of us, two adults and two children. With the all you can eat we ordered 500ml of soft drinks for the kids and two Carlsberg beers for us. The total came out to DKK332. Very reasonable in an expensive place like Copenhagen. The food? The pizzas were very good considering we weren’t in an Italian pizzeria and the pizzas weren’t cooked in a wood-fired oven. We had several different slices of what was available and a good serve of the buffet salads. There was an ample selection of olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, capsicum, lettuce, corn, carrots, dips, pasta salad, etc. To add was the excellent service. We sat opposite the pizzaiolo, a stocky Indian fellow. While churning out pizzas we had a short chat with him. He sure knew what he was doing, labouring away on what looked like a dozen pans.

Astor Deep Pan Pizza,797SusanB,"April 29, 2017",Great Tasting Pizza,"Having just arrived back in a wet Copenhagen after a trip to Malmo, we spotted this unassuming Pizza Restaurant near the main Railway Station. There was an “all you can eat“ buffet (pizza and salad) for around 900 DKR but we opted for the main menu choosing garlic bread as starters and then a deep pan pizza each – Vegetarian for me and Hawaiian for my mum. The garlic bread was lovely – two slices each which were not greasy and tasted yummy. The pizzas when they arrived were great – with lots of toppings and an incredibly light base. The restaurant got progressively busier as we continued our meal – we were there around 6.30pm - so booking in the evenings is probably recommended, especially with the restaurant’s proximity to the Tivoli Gardens. The salad bar was kept immaculate – no mixing of ingredients and the buffet would probably be my choice next time. Great friendly service – would love to make a return visit, and overall price was reasonable.",5

I did find out that you are supposed to use your same plate when you go back for seconds or more, unlike the expected clean plate each time as in the U.S. I was not happy that two sodas cost within a couple dollars of the actual meal. I was especially not happy that they told me that there was an extra, rather high service charge for using an American MasterCard.

The chef asked me how it was made, went to a nearby grocery store, bought the ingredients and made it for me without even asking for a an extra price. How is that for a service minded staff?

Nice selection: Korean, Thai, tacos, burgers, fish & chips, duck sandwiches...a great place to go with a group and options that ranged from healthy to indulgent. I ordered a bento box from one of the Asian food vendors; it had crispy shrimp, fresh salmon sashimi, rice, and tons of veggies, and it was really good! Another friend had fish tacos and enjoyed them; still another had a green papaya salad and noodles and raved about the taste.

Often you could find an establishment trying to be both lacking but Falernum pulls it off without too much fuss. It has the atmosphere of a french winebare with a relaxed cozy mood, but still manage to serve some above average food. Reasonably prized too. I've visited twice and the first time the service was very impressive and personal. The second time it was less remarkable, although nothing to blame either.",4

My wife and I were lucky to get a couple of seats at the bar when we strolled in quite late on a Saturday night. As we had already dined out, our intention was to enjoy some wine, and enjoy we did! The staff were really friendly and we took some advice from an enthusiastic chap who reminded me somewhat of a young Gordon Ramsey without all the expletives of course..Ha-ha! Seeing as it was our penultimate night in Copenhagen, we opted for a delicious bottle of Italian red wine from Tuscany. All in all a really enjoyable evening with some engaging conversation with people seated next to us. Cozy, friendly with lovely wine. what more could you want?",4

I ordered the cheese plate & the chicken terrine. We arrived early evening (without a reservation) & picked a pleasant table by the window and it was enjoyable watching the world go by. We then shared a chocolate pudding which was delicious. Nice change from the many restaurants that offer taster menus or loads of food. We really enjoyed what we had & we liked the vibe of the area.,4

We found that most Danes eat early. We took the last table around 9:30 before the kitchen closed at 10:00. We took a bottle of Kung Fu Girl Riesling which we adore and Multiple Gin tonics. Our waitress was more than out standing a we never expected such a level of service from a small place like this. The tapas were Danish Style and lovely. We enjoyed Goat cheese salad, 2 orders of scallops, Steak that was on special that evening and great homemade bread.

Falernum,Norwegian1975,"January 21, 2015",Great experience on the 'wrong' side of city center ;) - need to go here,"Visited a friend who lives in Copenhagen. She had booked a table saturday evening at 19h:00. Since I stayed at a hotel close to the 'Raadhuset' this was only a 10 min walk. The restaurant is in the opposite direction of 'Strøget' and I guess - for many tourists/visitors - on the 'wrong' side of where to go and have a look once in Copenhagen. But this side of the city is definetely worth a visit. A lot of different bars and nice restaurants in the area and none of them looks at all 'touristy'. Luckily we had a reservation...place got packed really fast. The ambiance is really relaxed and the crowd was a good mix. They update their menu quite often and the service was quick and very service-minded. We got attention of the waiters really fast and they explained the menu really well. The food was really good and they even let us taste a couple of wines before deciding on which one we wanted for our main course!!! That os one thing I do not experience often. Later in the evening - as the place gets more and more packed - the ambiance is getting more as a mix of restaurant and bar. They have a great bar where you also can sit down for eating or just having a drink. All in all - great place, great food, great people working there and awesome ambiance. Just my kind of place. I am so comping back here on my next visit to Copenhagen. Thanx for a great experience.",4
Falernum,KatKatAbekat,"December 8, 2014",Great wine and hang out place,This place is where the locals meet for a glass of wine after work. On weekends it is cowded but the vibe is great and the wine even better. My favorite is the Kungfu Girl Rieslin ,4

The dishes are very small, you will need 3-4, which will set you back about 200-300 dkr. I had the aspargus that was quite good and the shrimps that was also good (only 3 of them though). Also had the fish of the day, that was very dissapointing, it had no taste what so ever, just a lot of bones. The wine list is long but quite boring, glasses from about 75 dkr.

Plates are a bit small but good and not so expensive, can't say about the wine because we don't drink. The only negative thing was that the the door was open for the whole evening and even if we and other customers asked many times to close it because it was a windy and cold night they kept it open until it was clear we were very upset about it.

Although we prefer German white vines, and they don’t have any German ones on the menu we went. And we were not disappointed. The atmosphere and service was fantastic at a price level that almost surprised us. 400 Danish kroner for a bottle of dry Spanish white that’s reasonable. The snacks are also good. So yes.

We were there for 15 minutes waiting for our order, and judging by the number of customers they served during the time, this place is super popular. It is now our preferred Thai take-away place in Copenhagen.",4
Thai Asia,Liam M,"April 23, 2015","Great food, Great value.","If you don't fancy paying the prices of the restaurants on Nyhavn try this great take away. The food was very good and not too expensive.There is room inside for about 6 people to eat but we took ours back to Hotel Bethel and the staff let us eat in the breakfast area. Be careful what you order, it all looks, smells and tastes great but we ordered far to much and couldn't eat it all.",5
Thai Asia,Kvarnen,"April 19, 2015",Nice and priceworthy Thai takeaway,We just went around the corner from the hotel to get a something to eat and found this place. It does not look so good and inside it is hot and steamy but they for sure can cook. Very nice and priceworthy. Excellent spice not too much not too little. Recommend it for take away.,4
Thai Asia,skatterns,"March 28, 2015",Yum!!,"Found it online, very good value for money. Food was very tasty and fresh. Wouldnt go past it, absolutely amazing yellow curry, amazing flavours. Have yet to find any thai as good in london. Highly recommended!!!",5
Thai Asia,Ytinifni,"December 2, 2014",Best Thai Food Ever,"I happened upon this restaurant as I was strolling around Nyhavn. It's literally a hole in the wall, family owned, take out restaurant. The ladies behind the counter are cheerful and helpful. The food is fresh and delicious and relatively reasonable as far as prices go in an expensive city. One can't ask for anything more. I order the ""yam yam"" one night and it was so good I went back a couple nights after and got fried fried. Surprisingly, the lady that took my order not only remember me from my first visit, she also remembered my order. I was quite impressed. If you are in the area you should definitely stop by. ",4
Thai Asia,BasiaMZurich,"July 9, 2014",Best Thai food since leaving Thailand,"We were wandering the tourist area of Nyhavn, hot and hungry. By default we entered a small takeaway - the Thai Asien, without huge expectations. Being such a touristy area, we had heard the food was usually not so good. But we were very happily surprised. My Laab Gai turned out to be absolutely incredible - generously filled with fresh herbs, spicy and great flavouring - the best I have eaten since living in Thailand. It didn't pander to the tourist palate at all - very authentic Northern Thai. My daughters ordered the red chicken curry and a pad thai - both also excellent. It was not expensive by Copenhagen standards - 270DKK for all three meals plus drinks and there was so much food we had enough to take back home for a second meal. If you like reasonably spicy Northern Thai food, this place is awesome.",4
Thai Asia,Rohit-Bhardwaj,"June 23, 2014",A good eatery in Nyhavn,"Situated at a great location in Nyhavn, this place is a much needed respite from the neighbouring tourist traps that sell you run of the mill hot dogs, sandwiches and salads. Super tasty food, super nice staff, super fast service and super affordable price for the large portions they serve !!! The lady across the counter even offered us extra rice for no extra price for our curries (green chicken and red peanut veggie). Although it is a take away place but has a few seats for those who wanna soak the atmosphere. The chilled Singha beer was available at a arm's length to wind up a great day in Copenhagen.",5

Thai Asia,Mtltraveller_8,"August 12, 2013",Yuck,"My wife and I agreed that this was one of our worst meals ever. We didn't expect much from a generic cheap Thai place but it still came up massively short. The food has no flavour and the ingredients don't seem fresh. If you can't afford to eat at a nicer restaurant, you're much better off just going to a grocery store and getting something there instead.",1
Thai Asia,rick525,"July 21, 2013",Excellent takeaway,"The place is tiny - only space for about four people to eat in and very warm - but the food is very good and is great for takeaway. Very reasonable price for Copenhagen and we found one dish was good for two people, making it a real bargain.",5

I've never been convinced about the merit of sliders but they are perfect when hungry and you can't decide which filling to have. The chef chose them for us (3 each)!

Despite being a couple of grumpy old chaps, the young and enthusiastic staff, Nanna, Frederick and Vanessa, made us feel so welcome we stayed for food and more wine in this quaint, quirky bar with its wood panelled decor and its vibrant atmosphere. The food was prepared virtually in front of us, very professionally, by the bar staff, and was utterly delicious. We opted for most of the tapas menu and both enjoyed it thoroughly.

Not that spicy anyway but very nice. The starters here have a normal size but all the main courses are extremely big.

But then again, I think they wanted us in and out the place as fast as possible. The starter was a chicken spring roll with a sweet sauce. The salad was a salmon salad with a lot of veggies - I was actually expecting a salmon fillet - but I got salmon cuts instead. The main was a sizzler with veal. In all the food was o ",3
Bonjour Vietnam,buratine,"February 13, 2015",A new food expierence,I like Vietnamese food and have been to a few restaurants in Copenhagen. In Bounjour Vietnam my main course was a steak of veal made in traditional way. It was the first time I tried it and I loved it because that it was a new taste for me. The starters and the chokolade dessert were also good. This is not the best Vietnamese restaurant in Copenhagen but if you are not far away and want to get your food fast you are welcome to visit this place.,3

The food was nice, especially the soup which I like very much, the other dishes were ok, I am just not very fond of fried food. The salmon salad was good too, and we had an overwhelming chocolate dessert. overall the food was quite good, but the service was less satisfactory. The waiters were confused and messed up some requests, and the restaurant was just too crowded and messy. In my view it should not have so many tables for that space.

Other tables are served as each dish was ready so that diners on the large table near us all ate at different times. Drinks seemed to come quite quickly though! It was altogether too noisy for us, but the food was good and the portions generous. We ate from the vegetarian (vegan) menu.",3

The prices are very reasonable too so you get value for money. They also offer a set menu which is great value for 3 courses. Dessert selection is limited but still tasted good. Service was friendly which is refreshing for Copenhagen, and food was served in good speed given how busy the restaurant was. You won't leave here hungry - highly recommended!!",5

Bonjour Vietnam,TripNL,"December 24, 2013",Oh la la!,"This restaurant is located very conveniently to the Radission Blu Hotel. The food is authentic Vietnamese and an obvious popular place to eat in Copenhagen. We attended with a large group (about 50) on Christmas Eve (the restaurant remained opened specifically for us). Given the large group, I expected chaos, and while the food was (understandably) slow in arriving to the table, it was delicious. I had the Pho, the duck and the chocolate dessert. Husband had the same, but also ordered some snacks. It was all excellent quality and quantity, and very reasonably priced. All of our dining companions expressed great satisfaction with their meal selection as well. The atmosphere is quite cosy and I expect the service is impeccable with a more orderly clientele (our crowd became somewhat rambunctious and it was apparent that the staff were a little overwhelmed - but in a good way. There were a few mistakes on some bills, but it was handled graciously and appropriately by the staff. We were all very grateful that the staff gave up their Christmas Eve to provide us with a wonderful and enjoyable evening. It was an excellent experience overall, and would highly recommend the restaurant.",4

In our opinion, the food is not Vietnamese authentic, but rather some sort of fusion. It tastes good, though, and outdoor seating is really nice. We ordered one set menu, with Cha Ca Hanoi (Fish Hanoi style) as main dish, Pho (Vietnamese soup) for starter, and fruit dessert. The dessert is very good, so is the Pho. Cha Ca Hanoi is only ok - it doesn't taste nor look like the dishes we tried elsewhere, either in the US (California or Texas) or in Vietnam, but it tastes ok.

As an appetizer, I had the Tiger prawns, chicken, bean sprouts, rice noodles and fresh cilantro wrapped in a fresh rispandekage. I followed it up with the beef filet marinated in Vietnamese herbs. For dessert, I can highly recommend the sour sweet dessert yogurt served with fresh tropical fruits.

The salmon salad tasted very sweet as well. The small dishes with shrimps were not good and we even got one which tasted like rotten fish, which is not good.

Cafe G,Justin_Dillon,"February 28, 2013",Drowned out by the jazz,"I dined at Cafe G after a long day of project meetings. A welcoming space which promised a good evening. Sadly, though, it didn't deliver. The live jazz was far too loud and drowned out all conversation with anyone but your nearest neighbour. The vegetarian choice was very limited and while I thought I ordered penne with a vegetable sauce I got a noodle stir fry. The service, otherwise, was very good and I could imagine that on a quieter night and with a different choice of meal it would have been a good evening. As it was, I could not wait to leave.",3

We walked past several times during our stay and planned to go for a glass of wine. Instead, we got breakfast one morning. The omelets were very tasty and well presented. The pastries the expected excellent Danish fare. We rarely eat breakfast in European restaurants, usually making our own or grabbing the hotel breakfast, so I've little to compare to with regards to pricing. While a little high by North American standards it was reasonable for a city which can be hard on the pocketbook. It would be great for brunch if you've been out late in Copenhagen the night before.",4

Dag H,Freedom818904,"October 9, 2020",Not good enough,I havent been here in a long time and now I know why. I ordered brunch and got the usual big plate. All the bread was cold also the toasted rye bread. The avocado bread tasted of the grapefruit and the cheese bread if the pancake syrup. There was a weird falafel looking thing that tasted only of cumin which also completely disguised the dip. The humus was just wrong and the avocado served with nothing but sesame no salt no lemon no nothing. There was a perfectly boiled egg and a very good cracker. Plain cubed fruit very very cold. Why is it so poor? It would be so easy to serve a few good things with a bit of attitude,3

While we were reminded that we needed to place our order, once we decided it seemed difficult to get hold of our waiter. The food was ok, bistro-type cooking, lacking a bit in imagination. The risotto was very heavy considering how a good one can in fact be made light. The restaurant closes at 11 pm (on a Friday) and we left at exactly that time but had been reminded sooo many times that they ""soon"" would be closing (starting at 10 pm?). I find the closing time to be lacking in synchronization with the day and the waiters here to be indifferent at most, given my first experience was a bit similar with a different waiter. And yet, the food is nothing to ""write home about"" as we say in Danish. ",3

Dag H,203pia,"July 4, 2014",Dag H has rats running around in the outdoor serving area!,"Tonight I went for a coffee with a friend, sitting outside. When it got dark we saw more than one rat running around under the tables. The waiter was very much aware of this, but tried to convice us, that the rats were mice. I was there with a vet, and she knows the difference!!. I wouldn't recommend this place. Any place can get to deal with rats. What is very concerning is the staffs lack of action.",1
Dag H,briosk,"June 15, 2014",A bit over-priced but accessible and never overly croweded for lunch,Dag H has most of the regular lunch options that can easily fit in as a dinner meal. The value is really in the lunch especially with the outdoor seating. A good place to grab a good sized lunch and a pint or two if you're trying to avoid the more formal restaurants near Citadel or just looking for a US-style bite to eat. The chicken sandwich and fries are delicious.,3
Dag H,Ali446,"May 19, 2014",Lovely brunch spot in Copenhagen,"We were looking for a really nice brunch spot in Copenhagen to celebrate our last day of holidays, and found it at Dag H. There are two main brunch options, we both went for the meat one not the vegetarian. It was delicious! Make sure you are hungry as the serving is very filling and has everything from cheese and salami to Icelandic yoghurt and chocolate croissants. The coffee was also really nice. Make sure you book or arrive as it opens as it's really busy on weekends.",4

We had a fixed three course dinner at the RIDICULOUSLY low price of DKK200 ( I estimate it's approx 30-33$ /20£/ 25 Euros w today's exchange rate), but there's also an a la carte option. The food was delicious, the room beautiful, there was an open fireplace, nicely located....but the service was S L O W!! Two of us wanted the fixed three course meal, so the other two naturally had to wait for their main course while we had our starters, but yet it took forever for the main course to come. It took one hour from the time we got our starters until the main course was served. Twice we asked for refills on our water and for extra drinks, all three times we had to ask again after 10-15 minutes,and we still had to wait some more, and were even told at one point that ""it will soon be ready"".

And I can’t help but wonder whether it is my foreign name and accent that made them think they could get away with it. Like at Grøften in Tivoli, where my guest and I spoke (native) English to each other and therefore it was natural for the waiter to address us in English. We had a classic platter of Danish “cold kitchen” food, beer and snaps. When I got the bill, it was MUCH more than the cost of what I had ordered. When confronted, the waiter insisted that the bill was correct, but then I spoke to him in Danish and said, “det kan altså ikke passe” – and suddenly he said, “Åh unskyld hr. Det var min fejl”. But that’s another story and maybe I’m becoming paranoid. Maybe the waiters at Grøften try that on the natives, too, after they’ve consumed beer and sna ",1

It's also nice to be able to sit inside with a log fire in winter and outside on tables in summer (it is quite a busy road so may not so great in rush hour). They were also pretty family friendly. While there isn't a kids' menu they did a version of a dish for our daughter and didn't charge us full price for it. They are quite clear that they don't want you to let your kids run riot (there's a sign as you walk in outlining a code of conduct for parents with little kids) but actually I think that's fair enough for everyone.

My wife's pate was very good - her words. For our mains my wife chose the roast duck breast while I went for the home cooked meat loaf. All in all well-seasoned, properly cooked. The price of 2 glasses of wine and 2 yuletide beers with dinner and entrees came out to a respectable 700DKK - the price I would expect to pay for a good meal. Clientele included young toddlers, younger and older couples casually dresses. All in all a good experience.

We were with two local students who knew to ask for a student discount and thus we paid about 6$ each for personal pizzas with whatever toppings we wanted. For some odd reason we were all feeling Hawaiian pizza was the move so we got four Hawaiian pizzas that did not dissapoint. Danish Pizza does not have any reputation to Americans like us but we were delightfully wow'ed by the tastiness of the pizza. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a casual place to eat for little coin.",5

After smelling the aroma of fresh pizza when we walked by, we decided we would have to try something here. We order the Pizza Bolognese and the Primavera. The Bolognese was good, but unusual - it literally had bolognese sauce drizzled on it, but the Primavera, mamma mia. Without the tomato sauce base, the different flavors really stood out - mozzarella, cherry tomato halves, prosciutto slices, and shaved parmesan drizzled with olive oil and topped with fresh rucula. Delicious! Not bad prices either, though not as cheap as chain pizza joints at home. The service was quick given that there were about 4 groups ahead of us. We bought some beer at the 7-11 (surprisingly cheaper than the Super Kiosk next to the pizza place), and had a great dinner! Would have loved to go back to try to the sandwiches. We saw them making one while we were waiting on our pizza, and it looked spectacular.",4

The sandwiches are pretty huge, and so stuffed with filling (much better than UK sandwich places!) and only 49DKK (pizzas were that price too) Definitely a great place to grab food, and the turn around time wise is great even though there was only 2 of them, and they had a few orders on.",5

You don't expect to leave a vegan restaurant full, but we all were completely satisfied. His starter was a hearty, chunky tomato soup which could have been enough for a light meal on its own. I had a tasty cucumber avocado beet seed salad, all beautifully arranged. Also, a sizable portion for a starter. My entree was a lovely melange of grilled mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, potatoes and many exotic sprouts and seeds. His was a nut roast which reminded me of a croquette. He was too full to finish it all so I got to enjoy a large chunk of it. Lastly, the chocolate dessert was unbelievable.

Not intrusive and not neclecting, just right. The servings were some of the best dishes, we've had in many years. Exiting, tasty, innovative and different. The oyster was excellent, as well as the kaviar and the squid. Some of the traditional South American veggies as well were beyond excellent. The combination of fish, veggies and a small piece of meat with a Venezuelan twist proofed to be magic. All in all probably a top 3 meal on our personal restaurant meal list and at a quite reasonable price, though it's in the costly end. Only small issue in this place are the acoustics in the room.

If you are not used to the Danish culture, indifferent service can tarnish an otherwise great experience. At Taller, they have the perfect balance - friendly staff, happy to chat and banter with the clients, attentive service, easily adaptable to our lactose intolerant diner. An intimate setting with an open kitchen from where culinary miracles emerge at just the right intervals. As for the dishes - refreshing, unusual (but not off the wall) blends of tastes and textures inspired from Venezuela, beautifully presented and just the right size - ignore those idiots who complained that the portions are too small!!

Nice desserts, and please also remember that their cheese selection is very good. It is not a big restaurant, but you will always be met with a smiling team guiding you through you experience. Because here the lunch or dinner is an experience, not just a meal. It is located near Gråbrødretorv, so not really hard to find and close to everything else you want to be close to.

Bar'Vin,Thomas W,"August 4, 2017",Very disappointing,We had been before and was looking forward to bringing friends. But ended up being embarrassed by picking this restaurant. Food was prepared with absolutely no care and prices were way too high for the quality served. Starters came in after 2 minutes and had obviously been sitting in the kitchen for a while. Braised cabbage with a handful of almonds for 175 kr (23 euro) as a main course - really? Two tiny pieces of pork with vegetables and crackling out of a plastic bag for 225 kr (30 euro) was simply not good enough. We cannot recommend going here to anyone and hope management reconsiders their strategy... ,1

We went in and I asked if we could get a drink, so we sat down at their little bar. After one beer, the bartender asked if we would like a table for dinner, and of course we agreed;. the were extremely accommodating considering we would be eating before they were officially open. The most memorable thing we had was an antipasto plate...wow!! I also had a Caesar salad with the addition of the fresh scallop appetizer. My dh had a steak, which was okay, not great.

Boston Grill Mayfair,BMcL93,"January 6, 2017",The most disappointing nachos I've ever tasted,"We went to Boston Grill as we had been craving nachos all day and noticed on the menu earlier the previous day that they sold them. As we entered the place was completely empty and it felt quite weird to be sitting in such an atmosphere. Despite this, we ordered a portion of nachos each (which were not cheap may I add) and got excited about the fact they were served with chilli. When one thinks of nachos, or looks at a definition of a nacho online, it is described as 'a tortilla topped with melted cheese and often additional savoury toppings'. Needless to say this is far from what we received. When they arrived the shock horror on our faces was one to be remembered. They arrived in a brown paper bag (with no cheese on them and slightly luke warm) alongside three small glass jars one with sour creme, one with salsa and the other with what I can only describe as a slab of shredded meat (far from what I would consider chilli). My experience of nachos has been tainted so much so that when I consider to order nachos in the future I will sound like somewhat clueless asking every restaurant 'what way are your nachos served' to ensure I do not have an experience of that like the one I had in the Boston Grill. Warning all those nacho lovers out there in advance!",1

Although understandably there is an American theme to the menu food should be judged by its taste and nothing else. A complaint by a customer that burgers in Boston would be served differently seems churlish. Quite simply the steak was the best we ate all week and given that all meals we savoured in Copenhagen were good this is a justified claim. Served in a delicious red wine sauce with real chips, not some strips of fried vegetable fat. As with the hotel service was excellent. There is an outdoor area which is slightly bland but that aside this restaurant is well worth a visit.",5

Boston Grill Mayfair,Holokauahi,"June 6, 2016",Doesn't deliver on its hype,"With a name like Boston Grill and a menu shouting confidently about aged Danish and American beef, my hopes were up. The restaurant itself is modern and has the kind of wood-paneled-looks that could sell the idea of ""steak house."" But, sadly, it doesn't deliver. Service was good, environment nice, and I like the ""chambered"" design of several eating areas, including outdoor. But the ""large"" aged Danish ribeye steak was not the marbled beauty advertised on the menu, but rather a dry cut with a bit of gristle wrapped around the outside, and, of course, over cooked. What we'd call in the U.S. a ""two dollar, road house steak."" The trimmings were fine, including really well done french fries and a fabulous Bernaise sauce. The bar has good beer and wine that is sure to satisfy. But when you come for a steak, and that's the main attraction, it needs to be good. Boston Grill doesn't cut it. After I was half way through my meal I noticed in fine print on the menu that Boston Grill is part of the O'Leary's corporate restaurant chain; I believe this is the same corporation that runs the O'Leary's Irish Pub chain that is common in international airports. Corporation foodstuffs are no substitute for a truly fine steak. I award three stars instead of just two for the fine staff and lovely setting at the Mayfair. Just be sure to lower your expectations, and order the burger!",3

pizzeria Venezia Nyhavn 31,Rita B,"June 16, 2017",Very Enjoyable,After several days in Copenhagen I had a graving for pizza so I did a google search and off we went to try a pizza. We never made it to the intended pizza place because we came across Venezia and decided to sit outside side and enjoy the weather. We found the man who took our order and the man who served us had a great sense of humour and were very entertaining. We asked how big the pizza was and they had no problem splitting the pizza for us. If you leave room for dessert the Tiramsiu is out of this world. We enjoyed the time we spent here so much we returned the day before we left Denmark. This time we went inside and sat beside a very nice family that had ordered their meals not realizing they could have split them. Their pasta dishes were huge but they said it was very good and it looked good.,4

We had the lasagne and one of the pizzas, and I can highly recommend the profiteroles which were fantastic (the best I've ever had and I've had a lot) The only issue that I had was that the wine that I really wanted they only did in the bottle and had a very small selection which was by the glass. As a young couple, the bottle prices were just too expensive for us to justify it. Having said that, their prices were no more expensive than anywhere else in Copenhagen. I highly recommend the restaurant, absolutely fantastic!",5

So, the filet steak was not filet steak and even a samurai sword would have had difficulty cutting through this sinuous piece of meat (which we did not pay for, so marks for that). The tortellini was dry inside an I really do not know what the filling was! Gorgonzola sauce was okay. The 2 pizzas we ordered for the kids were the soggy kind you get in restaurants that no longer care about their product. Nyhavn has fallen in the past years, maybe the rental prices are so high they have to save money on the produce to pay it.

The service was very good and very fast, despite the restaurant being busy. Our waiter was very friendly, and informative, not only about the menu but also about Copenhagen itself. As tourists this was appreciated. The menu was extensive, and the food was excellent. My daughter is very fussy about pizza and she loved her Margherita. My mother also enjoyed her pizza, which was large enough for her not to be able to finish it. I tried hers and it was one of the best I have ever tried. I ordered a chicken dish with truffle sauce which was extremely tasty. We felt that it was much better value than the food in our hotel restaurant (Marriott). We would definitely go back and definitely recommend it to anyone going to Copenhagen. The location on Nyhaven is perfect too. After we left the restaurant we were posing for photos opposite the restaurant, with the boats behind us and our waiter very kindly offered to take a photo of the 3 of us using our cameras.

Finally the waiter did not even try to return the change from our meal and must have assumed that it was a tip as we never saw him again!

The tortellini was a bit dry and the lack of sauce didn't help. My wife ordered a pizza that was quite tasty actually.

The price for two people with wine was very reasonable for Copenhagen which can be quite expensive. The service was great and the staff very friendly and helpful. We were staying at the Copenhagen Island hotel so it was about a 15 minute walk along the waterway. I highly recommend this great Italian restaurant if you are staying in the Copenhagen area!,5

Both pasta dishes were very nice and homely - the portions looked small but the bowls were enormous and we were stuffed by the time we'd ploughed through it all. Good unobtrusive service, not too long to wait for our meal despite the fact they were rammed full, and we'd had to wait 2-3 mins for a table. Overall a lovely start to the holiday.",4

As the people around us at other tables who had arrived and ordered after us had received their food long before us, it was obvious that they had forgotten our food. When we asked them, we received no apology or anything. Initially, the only remark was: 'Yes, it's coming.' But still no food another half hour later. When we paid the bill (by the way, no offer of compensation in any way, no complimentary espresso, nothing) we asked again why it had taken so long. The only comment then was: 'Where do you usually eat, at McDonald's? This is a restaurant and not a fast food chain.' Well, while I appreciate the difference between a fast food outlet and a restaurant, it was certainly unacceptable that a simple pasta dish took 90 minutes and that the tables around us were served in a more timely fashion. When we pointed that out the staff made racist remarks. In light of this, the rating 'terrible' is still too good, but unfortunately tripadvisor doesn't offer a more negative overall rating.",1

I am absolutely not an expert on Southern Indian cooking, but love Indian food generally. To discover dosa was fun, unexpected - an Indian savoury crêpe! This place is very simply decorated, even basic, but don't be put off, you go for the food, bring the atmosphere with you. The staff are very pleasant, helpful. We went for the ""all you can eat dosa"" option but actually had to decline after the second dosa, we were so full. Honestly, one was enough, very filling: the dosa is big, takes up an entire plate and a vegetarian type of broth comes on the side with 2 different types of all you can eat chutney to dip the dosa in. You choose from a variety of different fillings, vegetarian or meat. The dosa are nicely spicy (I like spicy food and was not disappointed, as one can be sometimes at Indian places in Copenhagen. Perhaps restaurants have adapted their food because perhaps many Danes are not overly keen on very spicy food. This place feels authentic). What is great is that so many of the options at theSouthern Indian are vegetarian. They have eat in or take out - either way, definitely worth trying this place. Oh, and the dosa are gluten free!",4

The South Indian Frederiksberg,Antony J,"July 17, 2015",The closest thing to South Indian but still needs work,"The food itself is the closest you can get to South Indian food in Copenhagen. However, being a South Indian I need the small details to be right as well. The staff is excellent and the food is actually pretty good. We had a chicken dish and prawns dish along with rice. Both were cooked well and had great flavor as well. I also tried the dosas and this is where i felt disappointed as i was expecting a crispy dosas but ended up with a thicker version of it. Great place and I will go back but hope it gets better.",4

The South Indian Frederiksberg,IshaniaDuval,"June 21, 2015",Nice food that won't bloat you out!,"Mainly offering a dosa menu, if you don't mind a long walk to get there if you are staying central, it's worth a visit although I would say it's not particularly attentive. We waited 45 minutes to get our bottle of wine and had to ask for help translating the menu. When we did ask, the staff were really helpful but sometimes you kinda want them to be a little pro active if you look like you are struggling. The food I'd say was fine dining and didn't make you feel really full. ",3

My best pick are many but to name few – Chicken & Lamb curries, Briyani, Dosa’s, Parota and most important – Kathrikkai Kaara Kozhambu. Have introduced the restaurant to many of my friends and all of us are regular now, visiting atleast once a week and making sure that we are not missing any single opportunity to stop by even during week days. In CPH and if you have the love for Indian food, then you are missing the best food having not visiting South Indian.

The South Indian Frederiksberg,589MichaelP,"March 22, 2015",Refreshing Change - Very Tasty Southern Indian Food,"The food is very well prepared in Southern Indian style although perhaps slightly less spicy than the original but hot enough for most tastes. Not to be confused with the far more common Northern Indian style there is an even greater choice for vegetarians. The food is ""everyday"" food rather than an attempt at gourmet interpretations"".It is possible to dine out on dosas alone if one wants - they sell many different types. The Special Menu includes a prawn starter served with a lamb soup followed by a dosa of ones own choice then two curries with lamb and chicken served with both rice and parata , finished off with kulfi and chai or coffee - plenty of food indeed and all extremely good. The drinks on offer comprised of Indian wines (surprisingly good) or Indian beers plus soft drinks such as Kulfi. The Restaurant was newly painted with simple tasteful decor and comfortable seating. Prices are very reasonable. I was throughly impressed and cannot imagine that it will be long before I return. Already popular at weekends so best to book (easily done online). Takeaway possible but not for the paper thin dosas.",5

It sounded good on the menu, so we tried the langoustine pasta with mussels. The pasta was just barely edible, yes, all spaghetti (or better linguine, given a fancy name no one in Italy has heard of) is meant to be al dente, but this was almost inedible. There was ONE langoustine in each of our plates, a few shrimp, and five mussels. All swimming in a soup of cream. We were tired and hungry, so we ate it. It was terrible. The staff was lovely, they asked how we'd enjoyed it, and I had to be honest. They offered us one free glass of wine, they were so nice, that that felt nice too.",2

Service was top class with explanations of the dishes and wine to help us make our choices and we had a well paced meal. We started with charcuterie, the chorizo in particular was great. For the mains 3 of us had the burger which we can recommend, lovely meat and a good balance of toppings. One of us had the cod with a fresh crispy green salad. The tomatoes were special having been roasted earlier for 4 hours at 78 degrees (we were told). As a result they were like a self-contained tomato drink, delicious. For dessert we had all 4 dishes(not each!) and they were all excellent and very well presented. The chocolate mousse was so light, the creme brulee fabulous, the lemon curd delicious and the truffles superb. All this accompanied by excellent wines and coffee. The highlight was the Piu Piu which was really unusual, in a good way, it was naturally sparkling. We also had the principa mathematica, lightly oaked and an unfiltered red. All the wines complemented the food. Highly recommend this restaurant where we were able to sit out on the terrace and then move inside to very comfortable chairs and a well dressed table when the evening cooled down",5

Restaurant NOI,22club58,"July 31, 2018",Outstanding cuisine and service,"Apparently with a new direction this restaurant simply shines for dinner. Located in the Nobis Hotel it is far superior to ones idea of a typical hotel restaurant, even in the most elite of establishments. Two of us ate a leisurely, early dinner and then enjoyed a relaxing espresso and digestif in the elegant, adjacent bar. There is also an outdoor patio. The dining room decor is ones classic, white wood concept of Danish style. But the menu and the wine selection far surpass that. In particular the steak tartare, crispy salad and dorade preparations and presentations allow the natural flavors to blossom. Staff are exceptionally attentive and well organized, although the large room was less than half full when we were there. With the broad selection of well established and great restaurants in Copenhagen it is hard to stand out. This restaurant does that and, hopefully, will at least maintain its exceptional standard and new direction as the word spreads of its outstanding qualities, albeit for a well above average price.",5
