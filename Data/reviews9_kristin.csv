So collected it no problems and the order was ready in 3 minutes so no complaints there, I went and found a bench to sit in and started my journey!! The fries were poor and double dipped but lacked and needed truffle salt on and weren’t that hot either, the OK, strong taste of pepper immediately hit my taste buds, very dry and overall lacked something and when I got half way through I was bored and ended up giving the bread to a pigeon so overall not great, but I am spoilt and I use the gasoline grill a lot and so I compared this to the GG and it lost the battle straight away, my friend has the Vegan burger and he said it was great, but overall I was expected a hell of a lot more, but try it and see yourself as maybe I just had a bad one!

We told the staff that we could pay for the little drinks we've had and for the free salad only as goodwill. Then the staff told us that we had to pay full price for everything, even the food that we didn't order. I work myself in a service profession and this is NOT acceptable.

Small portions but this doesn’t really matter when it’s unlimited. Very good food esp crab salad, mini burger and chilli con carne. Drinks works on same principle- 75K for an open bar of beer wine and softies.

The food was to an excellent standard l highly recommend the steak that comes with truffle oil and Parmesan cheese.

We thought it was just for the young (we are no spring chickens) but were we surprised. You can eat and drink as much as you like for a fixed price (forgotten now but the price is the same for anything). They advise you to choose five dishes (but you can have more- or less). The wine and beers are within the price and you can have as much as you can drink. Schnaps is probably an added extra - we did not try it. Waitresses are brilliant and will help you understand whats going on and choose your dishes with you. Absolute Copenhagen gem. Thoroughly recommended.,5

The pizza was smothered in what I would consider far too much tomato sauce that the pizza was too rich and inedible.

We had Tuborg Classic beer to drink, which was 49Kr a pint - there was even normal Tuborg for only 44Kr.

House wine is cheap for Copenhagen and there are plenty of choices up the price range too. House wine is around £20 per bottle. We drank beer and that was a reasonable 44DKK. At the end of the meal we had an Irish coffee and that was an amazingly cheap 30 DKK.

The food was well cooked and presented (my pheasant breast in a saffron sauce was particularly suculent). There is a good choice of French, Greek and New World wines although they tended to be slightly above average price. Observations? Well the kitchen looked a little cramped and chaotic with frequent smashes of crockery (a Greek theme perhaps?), and I had to do a double take seeing one of the chefs leaving the WC without washing his hands!

We arrived around 8pm. The service was slow even though the restaurant was not busy. We had to ask for bread as we were not offered any. Because we had a Tivoli season ticket wild card we were entitled to a complimentary glass of prosecco but despite reminding the waiting staff twice this never appeared. All of our main courses were way too salty. We asked to see the dessert menu, which we were given but then the waiter went off and didn't come back.

Our waiter didn't come back to us until 9.50pm as he was too busy fawning over some business men nearby. We ordered two pizzas. About 10 minutes later we were presented with what I can only call slop. The pizzas in question were soaken in fat and were inedible. We were both very disappointed as it is a beautiful restaurant and we expected better. Pizza Hut would have done a better job.

We had to ask for water and looked like some of the customers got bread baskets but we didn't. The other people in the restaurant were also looking for the waiters as they didn't seem to be so efficient.

She just could not have the time to even clean the tables after customers were leaving. My husband ordered the food (and you have to pay when ordering) and after approx 45 min it arrived. We would have left before if we did not have paid.. When I asked why it takes so long I was told that the omelette is the dish that takes the longest time to cook: really, really??? Another waitress (because two more arrived after rush hour..) showed some real impatience that I dared ask her about our order. In the meantime other tables were served wheareas some of the people arrived and ordered after us. Finally voilà: the omelette arrived, and it was the worst thing I have ever eaten, was this really an omelette made with real eggs??!! (See the pics) Hopefully the other dishes were not that bad.

That's probably the cheapest lounge entrance fee I have eve seen so I decided to check it out. Since I saw that they had wine and beer, totally decided to do it! OK, so just about everyone and their mother were in there and it's not the biggest place but it had private bathrooms, upstairs away from the crowds, and full buffet spread of cold cuts, cheese, yummy Danish breads, fruit, and some other kick knacks. Best of all draft beer and wine! All of this for $24! Grant it I could not get a seat on a lounge chair so I had to sit on the cafeteria tables but it was totally fine! Wifi worked fine as well and a few magazines and newspapers (mostly non-English) to choose from. I have a feeling they had this special ""entrance fee"" due to some construction but it was worth it just for the alcohol and charcuterie/wine! I would totally come back if the price was the same but take advantage if you see it. So worth it!

It is located up a set of stairs (maybe you can reach it via a lift, I'm not sure). Compared to the many other lounges I've used in other airports, this one definitely falls near the bottom. There is not a ton of seating, and much of the seating is not conducive to actually doing work on a laptop, due to the shape and position of the chairs with respect to the tables, and the lack of plugs, charging stations, etc. The food supply is limited -- just a couple of salads, cold cuts, cheese, olives, etc. There are about 6 or so soft drinks available on draft, but none bottled. It is also sort of exposed to the terminal, so it is not as quiet as other lounges with more physical separation. There are two rooms to choose from, so I'm only speaking from the perspective of the one I chose.

Last time the lounge were TOO crowded and therefor much noise. Difficult to find seating, indeed a lack of seating. TOO many people were let in. The food could be better and more choice.

When informing the staff member about it in a friendly way I had to show here in the candle light that the glass was really dirty. Than I got the question if I wanted a new glass..... Off course I want a new glass. The wine was poured from one glass into another one which was dirty again. I just decided to leave it because of the unfriendly and uninterested behaviour.

The first thing that catches eye is a massive outdoor smoking area, which you need to pass in order to enter the cafe. The indoor seating is nice and the menu is quite broad in terms of offerings. The disappointing part is that if you come with a baby, a tall chair is brought for you from outside, cold and wet if the weather is bad. There is no place to change your baby, and you're offered to use a disabled toilet, for which you need to walk outdoors. The two toilets of the cafe have very deemed lights (presumably to discourage drug usage) and the cleaness of them is somewhat questionable.

Next bite was in teh tuna salad - this was prickling, oh, oh. Than the pasta became a try - again a disappointment, the taste was earthy and foul. Aftre that we stopped. We had some fruits which looked more or less fresh and tried the pan cakes from which we hoped that dough wasnot standing for one or two days next to the central heating.

Alas, there is no piano in the room any longer, and I was tempted to try their offering of tender roast boar instead of ""stegt flæsk med persillesovs"". The boar was served on a wooden platter and was all-right - but a bit ""boaring"". Their Cab Sauvignon house wine from Chile is a bit harsh. But the gorgonzola cheese on roasted rye bread with onion rings and a raw egg yolk, which ended the meal, was outstanding! The restaurant has a great location near Kongens Nytorv square, and I can recommend it for a pit stop with a cool beer and the cheese on roasted rye on a busy day in town.

My partner works as a Chinese cook and he was very disappointed. His steak lacked any kind of flavour even with a sauce. The fried rice De luxe filled me up but didn't excite my tastebuds. I had to add a lot of salt and soy sauce which I was so relieved to have some on the table! Waiter lacked in friendliness, a smile would go a long way!! All in all, it was okay, just lacked flavour, friendliness and was hugely overpriced for what we got.",2
Restaurant Beijing,Evancity,"March 28, 2019",50 krones for tap water!,"We asked for tap water. They charged us 25 krones each for tap water without telling us. That’s 8 US dollars for 2 glasses of tap water. They also added 7.5 krones on to the bill for using a credit card. Total scam. Do not eat here. We planned to return for dinner, instead, we won’t ever return. Enjoy your water money!",1
Restaurant Beijing,bluebear1905,"March 25, 2019",NOT BAD FOR A CHEAP LUNCH,"We visited the Beijing Chinese Restaurant during our city break in March and it was an ‘all you can eat’ eatery. The lunch Buffet was served from 11am to 5pm and cost 78 Kr (about £9) and the Dinner Buffer and Sushi was served from 5pm until 10pm and cost 128Kr (about £14.50). Copenhagen is an expensive place to eat out so when we came across this ‘all you can eat’ restaurant at a reasonable price, we decided to give it a try! We felt that the food served on the ‘all you can eat’ menu was very basic and there wasn’t a great choice. However, it was quite tasty and well cooked. There weren’t any sweets or desserts on the ‘all you can eat’ offer which we found a bit strange. Also it was compulsory that you had to buy a drink with your food. The drinks weren’t cheap and it cost us about £3 each just for a small bottle of water! The interior of the restaurant was a bit dated but very clean and tidy. The toilets where also really clean and the staff members were pleasant. Overall, we felt that it was a decent place to eat if you wanted to dine out on a budget. However, if money isn’t an issue for you then you would probably be better off going to one of the more ‘up market’ Chinese restaurants which can be found elsewhere in Copenhagen.",3

Restaurant Beijing,FanOfAlaska,"November 23, 2018",They rip you off by charging the wrong amount on your card,"Meal: edible. Service: non existent. Atmosphere: as expected in a place where there is a centrally placed threat in the menu warning that if you choose the buffet, take only what you eat, else you will be fined 50 DKK for leftovers (cost of buffet is 78 DKK). The shady manager guarantees a terrible time however, by scamming with the credit card machine. My 145 DKK tab was ""accidentally"" entered into the credit card machine as 245 DKK. I did not notice this, I was only asked to put in the pin code and was in a hurry for a meeting and out the door. When I realized the theft, I sent an email with all receipts proving they were in the wrong. Manager replied that he prefers to believe a version of events where I noticed their mistake and asked for a refund and they gave me cash. Stunned I asked why would this not be reflected on the receipts then? Any sane business man under these circumstances amends the receipt to reflect a 100 DKK cash given to customers (and why would I ask for a refund if I already got it). His response is that he would rather lose a customer and be in the wrong (as in steal from the customer) than give 100 DKK to a customer who doesn't deserve it. So there you have it, his business model: It is better to lose customers than to run an honest business without scamming with the credit card machine.",1

Restaurant Beijing,sasalan999,"September 30, 2016",Poor Service,"Hopefully I'm reviewing the correct restaurant here. I'm referring to the one in Frederiksberggade 28. This restaurant is upstairs above a Chinese take away stall. The advertising outside suggests a Chinese buffet with over 20 dishes at 79DKK, or thereabouts. On arrival, I was served quickly and shown to a table, no pleasantries, wasn't shown where the buffet was or any offer of assistance, simply, there's your table! Another member of staff came and took my drink order, again no effort to be welcoming or otherwise helpful. I realised that the buffet set up was behind a supporting wall and therefore out of my field of vision, but managed to work that out for myself. The advertised ""over 20"" dishes were in fact about 14 hot dishes, 10 salad offerings, and various sauces, salad dressings etc, which I felt was a bit of a let down. However to be fair the food was good enough without being anything special and I suppose you get what you pay for. They have warnings about surcharges if you waste food and I think you are limited to two platefuls also. If only the staff were a bit friendlier this might be a decent place for a cheap meal but I didn't really enjoy being here all that much.",2

The main courses were bland and runny and seemed to contain processed chicken strips. We were given a very large bowl of fried rice to accompany the main courses so at least we were full.

I entered the place and had to actually look for someone to ask if I could sit since the place was a bit empty. I was directed to a table and then after taking a look to the menu, went for the buffet option. The buffet had all those guilty pleasures typical from an Asian restaurant: fried nems, fried rolls, fried samosas, noodles and more. However, the choice was a bit limited though in my view.

The restaurant isn't crammed full of tables like many are, so it was comfortable to sit and talk and not keep bashing into other tables and chairs when going back and forth to the buffet. The food is as you'd expect from a buffet, quantity over quality, and OK there is lots that isn't Mexican food, but I enjoyed it. One downside was that nothing was labelled so I couldn't identify everything. As a vegetarian this was not ideal. There were Nachos, tacos, curries, pizza, chips, rice, salad, spices, pasta, spaghetti, fruit, pastries, pancakes etc. ",4

So we ordered the asian style buffet, and had a table close to the window so our son could enjoy some juggling and miscellaneous entertainment going on in the street outside. Fair enough: We did find food in the buffet, but nothing that created enthusiasm. Worst experience for me personally was that I visited the bathroom after my son already had started to eat. If I had seen the toilet before ordering food, I would have insisted on leaving. They simply don't have staff who knows how to keep a toilet clean.

The waffles were not fresh and first after half an hour we got to know that they were out of hot chocolate which we already had prepaid. Never go there again and I would not recommend for anyone else. Don't get blinded by the location, it shouldn't be hard to find something better, because it seems hard to find something worse.",1

Restaurant Amalfi,sorrylaurie,"July 30, 2016",Adequate,"My husband and I stumbled upon this restaurant. It was good, however not spectacular. It is nicely situated in an off the beaten track square. The staff was welcoming, providing us with a complementary glass of champagne. We both had pasta. My husband enjoyed his rigatoni. My pasta with Gorgonzola cheese was tasty, but very basic. Overall, it was expensive. However, I think Copenhagen is a very expensive city, so they were only charging comparable to other establishments. If you're on a budget, this isn't the restaurant for you. Nice heaters on the awnings if you visit on a chilly night.",4
Restaurant Amalfi,Karim L,"July 24, 2016","Bad burgers, and bad service","My wife and I was met by poor service from the mid to end. We ordered a chicken burger and a beef burger.

Well - that was true but tomato is not exactly the same thing as ketchu ",1
Restaurant Amalfi,Brian R,"July 23, 2016",Nice,"Lunch. One had cheese burger, one had veggie pizza.

Restaurant Amalfi,antonis_mpi,"June 7, 2016",Terrible ,"It is considered as Italian restaurant but I do not understand the point for that. The plates have no relation with the Italian cuisine.

Restaurant Amalfi,LLamps,"August 13, 2015",Chaotic service in a quiet square,"This restaurant is located in a quiet square off of the main shopping mile. The service seemed to be a bit chaotic. One waiter pushed us into ordering our drinks before we even had a chance to sit down, and then a flock of waiters descended on our table with our drinks, splashing and spilling, as they too quickly poured our drinks in our glasses at our table. The food, was ok. Three of us had a pasta with pesto and arugula dish and another had a pizza. The pasta was definitely better than the pizza. The only nice think about the restaurant was the location, otherwise, I'd recommend you just pass this one by.",4

I didn't realize it would be pan fried in panko, however, it was perfectly cooked, it was moist, delicate and delicious. However, we also ordered other items to share. The Bruschetta San Daniel was a bit unusual since it came with a thicker than normal piece of thin-sliced ham (prosciutto) which didn't look very good. It looked dry so I didn't try it. My son tried it and didn't like it. The Goat cheese salad, Insalada di Capra was better, however, it had a big piece of bruschetta on top and in the middle of it. The Pulled Pork Burger was dry because I chose not to eat it with the bun which was slathered with an orange aioli sauce. However, the green apple coleslaw which was in it was delicious. Others ordered the chicken dish and said it was dry. The bread served before the meal was actually really great. Slightly crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Our waiter was great though. Very friendly and nice.",3
Restaurant Amalfi,sunshinemichs,"July 16, 2015",Late Lunch,Stopped to grab a quick pizza with my husband here. We were starving and wanted to get away from the hussle bustle of the busy shopping street. The staff is friendly but our Margherita pizzas seemed almost microwaved. The bottom was mushy. Not good.

The food is actually pretty decent and well priced (hence 2 stars instead of 1), however the staff are extremely rude. Also, we asked for water to drink as we wanted a cheap meal out, however we were then asked to pay for this at the end. Would have been happy with this if we had known this before ordering. Then I went to pay by credit card and he added on a 'credit card charge' without telling me. He only told me once I questioned why I was paying more than what was on the bill. So we paid cash instead. This place ruined our night and I would warn anyone from eating here.",2

Restaurant Amalfi,Travelibrarian,"December 6, 2014",Good food with some reservations,"I ordered the ravioli with pesto and parma ham for lunch. I had no complaints with the quality of the food. The sauce was lovely, the ravioli tasted home-made, and it was perfectly cooked and attractively presented. The portion was rather small, especially considering the price. Service was rather cool. I'm not sure what the problem was with the service. I was dining alone and that puts off some restauranteurs. Maybe I wasn't glamourous enough? I'm quite used to northern European reserve, but I felt distinctly uncomfortable and unwanted. Still a ""very good"" rating based on the quality of the food, but I'd have to see an attitude adjustment from the wait staff before returning.",4

Restaurant Amalfi,LillyPilly229,"May 25, 2014",Worst service ever,"We were served by the angriest waiter I have ever met. He did not smile once and it seemed to be important to serve everything as fast as possible. We had their ""special menu"" with four dishes and a glass of sparkling wine. We asked a few questions about their wine list and he had obviously no knowledge about wine. Finally we got a bottle of red for 379 DKK and it tasted like it was a very cheap wine.He also kept on serving the food by stretching himself over the whole table everytime he served, which was a very strange experience. I believe he spoke little Danish and bad English. Food was not more than average and what seems to be a fancy restaurant on their website is more like a tourist trap. I would not come here again. The ice cream I got as a dessert was full of ice (maybe had been melting and frozen again) and when he asked how it was and I told him that it was full of ice and I did not want to eat it he said ""Yes, it is ice-cream!!"".Our experience was pretty bad. We were also disturbed by people coming from the streets playing instruments in the outdoor area and were then begging for money.",2

Not to large portions, but the Food all tasted good. I had to ask for a change of my meat since The pieces I Got was Well done. And Got a new portion with a smile. Good service. The cake was very good, served with icecreme. Nice. The Wine is a little High priced. A glass of whitewine is 69,- and The housewine (red) was a syrah at 279,- Water in a bottle (italian) is 59,- !

Inside there were no scallops and they no longer had lamb, so I opted for the “salmon rosace with tricolor caviar, topped with herb salad” followed by Ravioli with sage butter and parma ham. Both were quite good, but very small portions (only two ravioli on the plate!)
