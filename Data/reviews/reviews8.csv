Cafe World,Dave C,"August 10, 2015","Great Little Place, Great Value!","My wife and I were a little sunburned and groggy after bus and boat tours and found this place for a snack-- one of us got the Tapas plate and the other the Mediterranean Plate-- they were just about identical. That was a bit strange but they tasted quite good, well put together with good ingredients. Price was a bargain at 580, which probably included drinks. I'd go again if I was back in Copenhagen.",4

We wanted to eat, we were told that at the moment all the tables are full, maybe later, when someone leaves. So long we ordered drinks and waited on the couch. The table was released. The waitress came and said that the table was free. We sat there for about 15 minutes and started ordering food. Then somewhere an employee came and announced that other people who were booking the table would soon come to our table and asked us to go outside and find a free table with our drinks there. Explanations and annoyance didn't help. A moment later, three beautiful women walked in and were simply directed to sit there. This place is filthy. Discriminatory. I've traveled a lot, this sh**** customer attitude I've experienced for the first time.

We kindly asked whether we could fit two extra people on the end of the table and received a straight no from these two girls. They weren’t waitresses, but just seated people when they arrived. It was actually quite shocking... these two girls colleagues were running around like headless chickens serving food, drinks, etc. while they stood at the register gossiping and looking all miserable. Quite shocking. By far the worst service I’ve ever received and as I can this is a recurring theme at this place.

PS Bar & Grill,Peyman J,"June 13, 2017",racist employers,"I (Born in Iran) and my two Danish friends decided to grab a couple of cocktails at PS bar & Grill. As I am about to pass the guards, I get stopped, and he asks me where I am from, which I answered Norway. The guard does not believe me, even though I am speaking Norwegian to him, and wants me to prove to him that I am Norwegian before he will let me in. I therefore have to pass a pop quiz about Norway and show my Norwegian ID before he will let me in even though I am living in Denmark and showed him my Danish ID wish was not good enough. Now some of you will probably think it's normal that the guards checks ID, but my Danish friend who walked in front of me was wearing shorts and T-shirt, and he got in no questions asked. As I finally got accepted by the guard, it was my other Danish (half Danish half Serbian) friends turn, and he has a hipster beard which some people mistake him for being a Muslim. The guards stopped him as well because they wanted to talk with him, so I thought I could crack a joke to ease things up. So I said: ""He is not Norwegian, so he should not get in"" while laughing. The guard then answered: I am more scared of him wearing a bomb blowing us up. Not I m agnostic, and my two other friends are don't really care about religion but are Christians on paper. I would advise people from supporting a business that accepts racism.",1

We all had a variety of starters and mains and although the starters were on the small side they were really good, from the pork belly, scallops to the chicken wings. The mains were good as well, a few of us had the burgers and they were lovely but they were served pink, so beware if you don't like that. The steaks were perfect, the lamb was amazing !!

I asked if we could be notified if ANY other table became available and she said it was absolutely impossible.

The food is okay, a selection of starters/snacks such as fried squid, fried chorizo, glazed short ribs, foie gras terrine and so on. Then also a selction of pizzas and cuts of meat, a few fish dishes and then a bunch of side orders. Now I have been there twice and unfortunately the service is so so so slow ( maybe cause its too busy but hey then hire some more staff ). Due to the loud music ( at least during dinner ) prepare yourselves that if you are more than two it might be difficult to have a conversation.

Tempura rejerne som starters var SÅ lækre, knasende sprøde og friske. Udover en samling Letz Don fik vi også 3 x 2 sizzlings. De er meget delikate, spændende og anderledes, inkl. flot pynt og en japansk fisk, jeg ikke kan huske navnet på. Den hjemmelavede limonade var også velsmagende og med en lige tilpas balance mellem syre og sødme. Vi fik med et smil pakket de stykker, vi ikke kunne spise, ned i go-bag med frisk soya. Tjeneren og personalet i det hele taget var usædvanlig flinke, ligetil og serviceminded. Så der var en rigtig god og rar stemning på restauranten.

Casual during the day and afternoon and can get rowdy and busy at night - it doubles basically as a bar at night. They have high chairs and sofas which is great if you've got young children.

There was no line at the bar when I turn up to order, and he was serving the one guy next to me; I was next in line. Very shortly after I arrive, a line of 6-8 women started on the other side of the bar. Instead of serving me (while he clearly saw me) he started serving them. After waiting till he was done with the first girl I told him I was actually first but he told me to just go in line so I would get served after he was done with the other girls. The way he said this, the fact that that he was so rude will stop us coming here 2-3 times a week. Instead we went to the Dubliner across the road which I truly recommend you to go instead as well as they have fantastic service, the food is better, and the vibe more chilled! ",2

No one greeted us or acknowledged that we were there for a good 2 -3 minutes, we had turned around to leave when the barman asked us if we wanted anything, and not in a very friendly and welcoming manner. We asked for the menu and he said we had to walk to the other end of the counter to look at it (even though they were right in front of him and he could have easily handed it to us). They seemed to be annoyed that we were taking a long time to decide what we wanted to eat, which i found amusing. Then when we were ready to order, only then we were told that first we had to find a table or they would not take our order. Attitude all the way!!! Food was ok. My friend had the chicken pasta in a cream sauce which didn't taste of anything and was dry. I had the nachos supreme, which they clearly used cheap cheese slices that you take out of these plastic packets. We were extremely hungry, which is why we stayed, but not at all impressed.",2

The food came and I asked for mayonnaise to which he said they don't have it - the people on the next table had it. I asked to change my desert order approx 20 seconds after giving it to which he told me I couldn't as it had gone to the kitchen - there were only 6 people in the place so hardly busy.

Bad move, we then waited 30mins for a terrible plate of overcooked Nachos, which were the cheapest ones you can buy in any supermarket.

We waited a wee while for our food. My partner was served his lamb (where the meat was excellent) but the dish was served with a cold purée and was missing the potatoes. We asked our waitress whether the purée was supposed to be cold when served with a warm meat dish, and after reminding her again she finally asked the kitchen. After waiting several more minutes, where my partner was pretty much done with his meal, she came around and said that it was supposed to be cold. We didn’t really believe her and she didn’t seem very sincere or apologetic. She also didn’t pour our wine... all in all the service was pretty terrible, our waitress wasn’t sincere or apologetic and it didn’t help that the restaurant only had put on two members of staff for a Saturday night (who clearly weren’t experienced and admitted that they knew nothing about wine).

El Porron,Gus M,"April 8, 2015",The same old tapas in a place that belongs on a tourist beach in Benidorm,The food was okay to good but not very interesting. Guitars and the typical decorations your grandmother brings you from Spain are very cliche. I love tapas but there was nothing special or memorable except for the bad decoration.,2
El Porron,AndersC446,"March 14, 2015",OK but quality is lower than it was,the tapas are still original and Spanish. The staff is not routined and They come from many different countries (including Denmark and Spain). Por selection of wines. On the day They did not have cooled cava. That is inacceptable on a Saturday night. The beer is expensive. I think They are too bush gering many customers through causing lower qualityi.,3
El Porron,Jon B,"December 23, 2014",A bit overpriced for the quality ,"In this small restaurant hidden in a basement, a bit too much effort has been put into creating an 'authentic' Spanish atmosphere. Flamingo-dresses on the walls etc. rarely bodes well in my book ",3

It was within a few hundred metres from my hotel and it looked ok from the outside. My first impression was of a cramped but pleasant location which was busy but not packed. The staff were friendly and the Spanish chef, in particular, was a very very good host who was extremely enthusiastic about the food. The food was good and we lost count of the number of servings we had. It ended with a delicious dessert (a Catalan 'crème brûlée). I'm sure any of the several tapas restaurants nearby would have equalled the quality and value of the food but the ambience would be hard to beat.",4

It was ""the usual"" meat balls, tortilla, potatoes, which was unimpressive, the best was the fried shrimps and deep-fried cheddar and chicken. For dessert a boring ""crema catalana"", spanish creme brulee just without the vanilla. All-in-all nice interior, average food with no surprises at all, although I had expected that from a 14-course meal. If you are looking for a place with more delicate food, but less cozy interior, try ""Tapasbaren"" on Dronningens Tværgade.",3

We ordered 2 cold tapas and 4 warm, and asked for the 2 cold as starters. We also asked if bread was included or if we had to order it for the soup, they said it came with every tapas dish. We got served 3 out of 4 warm for starters and stopped the waiter and asked for the cold ones. She accused the kitchen as they usually serv the warm first and the cold last??? Then she said we could try and eat the warm dishes later and let her know if it gets to cold! We never got any bread and when we asked for it she said it usually comes with the shrimps( that we at that point already had eaten) and we could have it if we wanted. I told her it was all very confusing and that she messed up our dinner and that we were unhappy with the outcome. Hard to explain the whole dinner but they destroyed an evening with good food and we had to pay full price and even if they knew we were upset they didn't want to try and compensate us at all. Very ignorant and rude for paying 700dkk",1

It was the only place open around 14 in the area (at a cheap price, that is) and it was pouring outside. I took a sandwich, like 20 cm long, with salmon (lots of it) and salad. There was no problem when I said I couldn't take avocado in it. It was a delicious meal for 59kr. They have sodas for 20kr. Because of my schedule here, I also grabbed a box for later: the price will depend upon its weight. My box weights around 600gr and costs 94kr.

The food was good, especially the goat cheese with sundried tomatoes and horseradish wrapped in aubergine, and the wine was good. The dessert simply did not come until a waitress (not the waiter who took our orders) asked if we wanted the dessert menu, found out we had ordered already, and went looking for our desserts.

Then we requested to have four shot glasses chilled in the freezer. The waiter did not blink; he just did it, returning a bit later with four frozen glasses and a bottle of vodka.

Vi bestilte mange ting fra menukortet, og alt var virkelig godt, men vi vil særligt anbefale grøden og det virkelig gode rugbrød.

L.a. Tino,Foo-Ai,"August 7, 2020",New restaurant along the famous Nørrebrogade street,"We, three girls had dinner at this new set-up specialising in Latin American food. I have never tried it but one of my friends had. 3-course meal on a sweetdeal- great way to try out a new place which we have not been before. The first course was Ceviche -fish served on plantain. It was pleasantly done. The main course -Mexican spicy marinated chicken served with Yucca chips could have been better as the whole dish was lacking a 'wet' sauce and the chicken was a tad bit dry. The dessert was a pure delight- very delicious with sweet cinnamon- caramel topping on some cream pudding. The drink served was Rose Wine Gazon Pinor Noir from Uruguay. Very refreshing and highly recommended. Overall - a mixed visit due to the above. It was a sweet deal and we would not have paid the full price for the meals based on the above. Hope the restaurant chef will work on the main course as there is certainly potential for it to be a great dish. Staff was friendly enough. Wishing the best to the owners for their new set-up.",3

THAIAWAY,ClausJ,"February 2, 2017",food is ok - but EXPENSIVE for a takeaway.  ,takeaway sort of middle of the road.   ok menu - as always with thai takeaway its more or less the same ingredients that is mixed in different ways - big portions.  but pricing is like a restaurant which its definately not.,2

THAIAWAY,Towol06,"June 17, 2013",fluctuating experiences,"I have ordered food from Thaiaway at least five times now as I live pretty close to it. The experience has varied a lot. Some of the meals are basically a rip-off (such as their soup, which consists of two shrimps and some mushrooms in a broth) while their noodles are quite good but you never really know as it depends on who is at work the specific night. Sometimes you can barely taste the chilli in the meals and other times there is a delicious chilli flavour. Other times they either have run out of certain vegetables or seafood - or they simply have forgotten to put it in the meal. Sometimes you ask for shrimps and they put three shrimps in your meal and other times you get a decent handful of perfectly cooked shrimps. When it is good, it is good but compared to the price you do not get much value for money considering that you only truly get what you pay for every now and then.",2
THAIAWAY,JanuaryTravels,"November 6, 2012",Tasty Thai take-away,"I have ordered from Thaiaway three times now, once from the inner city and twice from Frederiksberg, and really love it. The meat could sometimes be more tender, but the flavors are amazing and all the vegetables and spices taste super fresh and delicious. They also make the food right in front of you, which I always find reassuring. Portions are a good size, and prices are excellent if you consider what you would have to pay in the grocery store for the same ingredients. If you like it spicy, I recommend number 28, which I unfortunately cannot tell you the name of, as tripadvisor thinks it's profanity... It's not profanity, it's Thai, haha!

Had a gorgeous bottle of red wine and the service was alright. The place is quite small and cosy and the smell of pasta and mushrooms wafted around, so the atmosphere was great. Then we had the pasta dishes, which is where it all went downhill. We ordered a seafood and carbonara. The carbonara was dripping in its sauce, which is odd because normally it would be more creamy and hold together. There were huge chunks of bacon on top. We left it uneaten. With the seafood dish I was expecting a few prawns or a bit of fish and maybe a scallop or two and instead had one small crustacean on top (which barely includes any meat in its tail) and then a couple of tiny mussels in a tomato sauce on top of a heap of pasta. This was quite a letdown. The pasta itself was really nice but the sauces and accompaniments were pretty much missing or like an afterthought.

This is not a fancy place (to get to their restrooms you walk through the actual kitchen) and there is no expensive conceptual styling - the food and the friendliness of the staff totally make up for this. This place was made 'con amore' and it really shines through. We had loads of braised beef, oven roasted veggies and mash potatoes along with a generous dollop of homemade hollandaise. Including all the bread we could eat. Our son even charmed the staff into a free piece of chocolate cake.. 3 meals Including coffee, drinks and a bread to take home we paid around 300 Dkk.

Location is great but the food was just okay. But, I got a little frustrated when trying to order some water. While I don't agree with it, many restaurants have a policy of having to make money on anything you drink. Even if what you want is only tap water. I saw that a couple sitting next to us had a pitcher of water and I requested one. They said I could only get it if I ordered a bottle of wine... but I could pay for Italian bottled water. I offered to pay for the pitcher but they said it was not possible and, I quote ""rules had to be followed"". The only reason why we didn't leave was that we had already ordered food. If tab water is considered really good in Copenhague, I personally would rather drink that then have water bottled in Italy and transported all the way to Denmark. I had no choice but to pay for the Italian bottled water. Again, it's not about the money, it's about the unnecessary environmental impact.",3

My wife skipped the Danish specials (even though they really looked good, we had already sample Danish open sandwiches earlier) and had Fish & Chips which were ample, but pretty standar ",5
Promenaden Tivoli,RNSAILOR2,"July 15, 2017",Good fish....,We came here for dinner and my husband ordered the salmon and I had the ribs which were the house specialty. His salmon was perfect. It had a lovely sweet sesame lemon sauce on top served with an Asian inspired coleslaw and baby boiled potatoes. I had the ribs. Coming from the south of the United States where rib places are everywhere these were by far not up to the southern standard. The ribs were very fatty and did not have a lot of meat. The coleslaw that came with the ribs was planned and the potato was boiled with some kind of parsley flakes on top of it. If you're used to good southern ribs don't order these,3

Unfortunately the food was not as tasty as it looked. The salad was mediocre having pre-cooked chicken on the salad. The fires were nice and fresh. The ribs had clearly been cooked long before. Of course this is BBQ and you would expect that because of the slow cooking time for ribs. Well, not these riibs. They were almost rib jerky! Very chewy and stringy. The flavor was fine but just not very well prepared. I saw a kids burger on the next table that looked pretty good although I did not taste it so it may also be pre-cooked.

As my wife is pregnant, there were some limitations on what she could eat safely. The first course was a half lobster - which we subsequently found out was served cold. Given that we did not know how long ago the lobster was prepared (for fear of salmonella), we asked if my wife's portion could be at least heated up. The manager told us it wasn't possible as that was ""changing the menu"". I then asked if they had a microwave or oven that they could pop the lobster in and...he said they don't' have a microwave or oven in the kitchen!!! I found that downright lazy...they just could not be bothered to heat it up or at least 'check with the chef' what he can do. Not to say the least, we were not impressed at all as my wife ate bread most of the night until finally the main dish arrived (mind you everything was pre-prepared as it was a set menu). The only nice thing was the girl who was serving us who was apologetic and kept feeding my poor wife bread. DO NOT ever eat at this place in Tivoli.

We reserved in advance, and had a warm welcome from the head waitress upon arrival. All but the six-year old opted for the ribs, and they were HUGE! Even the child version for the ten-year old seemed over sized. And they were absolutely delicious. Even the ten-year old ate every bit of her portion, and really enjoyed being allowed to use hands and face. Spare Ribs are quite messy stuff, but all is taken care of by the restaurant by handing out good sized bibs, plenty of kitchen tissue and buckets for the waist. And at the end an abundance of wet tissues to clean up. The six-year old got his spaghetti just to his liking, with bacon and Parmesan, so everybody was happy and went out to enjoy the pleasures of Tivoli.

In fact, tacos are only sold in sets of three and all three must be of the exact same kind. My hopes of sampling three different types of taco quickly evaporated, as I just couldn’t imagine myself consuming nine tacos in order to sample different three styles (not that I haven’t managed this feat before). A truly curious business model in which they apparently make food, but won’t sell it to you unless you order more than you necessarily want.

We went back to Louise, the Herman replacement, last month. The layout of the room is definitely more casual, I felt at the prices we were paying I enjoyed the more upmarket look of Herman. The food looked great, but did not have the extra sparkle we saw previously and I really felt that the tastes were not as interesting. We had Frikadella (meatballs) for one course and they were not special at all (in my view). The service was great and friendly, but we also saw a bit of a slow down by the end of the evening when we were ready to go home, which was a bit dissapointing.

The coffee is good, but it is indeed so many places ... The place is really small and nothing extravagant ... The service is very low key and nothing extraordinary ... But still COFFEE just something special !! I think maybe it is the combination of always sweet, friendly and informal service, fully implemented Vesterbro atmosphere and especially really good coffee that does the trick for me . The best COFFEE-highlight is undoubtedly on the bench outside with a warm latte in hand and the sun on your face while you just thrives in the Istedgade pulse. Here you get Copenhagen quite close!

After sitting down for a few minutes with him, headed over to use the toilet. A few seconds later, the restaurant manager & owner was deliberately knocking and trying to open the toilet door. Slightly startled, upon opening the door she accused me that I am not a customer ‘You just walked in straight from outside’. Shocked and embarrassed at the manner of such confrontation, I made my way to the coffee area to point out I have been sitting inside the cafe with my husband. She rudely responded she didnt see me and usually people usually come and say hello to the staff before sitting down. Seriously? Am I expected to say hello to all cafe staff members before joining my family who is using the cafe for hours just so that am not accused of using ladies toilet? Approached her later when she explained her side of the story to say she is working alone and does not wish to have this discussion, that’s it. Refused to even hear me out or my husband who later wished to speak with the manager (that’s her unfortunately, yeah I know). Got off early from work for a rather enjoyable evening, it turned out to be hurtful and humiliating. Stop being rude and stop treating customers like criminals.

AC Lounge,Gabriel H,"November 2, 2016",A friendly place for breakfast or a quick bite,"The Library Restaurant is located off the lobby of the AC Bella Sky hotel, next to the Bella Convention Center. It is elevated by 2-3 steps from the rest of the floor and has a semi-circular shape, with tables and chairs on both sides. The furnishing is modern, very Danish in design, as is the rest of the hotel. A generous breakfast buffet is served on a triangular table in the middle, with coffee and other beverages just off the restaurant, underneath an interesting garden arrangement erupting from the wall. Breakfast includes cold cuts, cheeses, liver pate, smoked fish, breads, butter, fresh fruit and picked veggies. The coffee is very good, the juices not quite in the same league. Next to the coffee display you will find scrambled eggs or quiches, as well as sausage and bacon. Overall, a satisfying International breakfast with some Northern overtone ",3

It seems they choose who they will give a table depending on if they like the look of you or not. Myself and my friend walked in as we noticed they had plenty of tables spare. Our greeting was an extremely screw faced woman asking ""what do you want"". When we asked for a table she seemed to be deliberating whether or not to grant us one. She then looked us up and down, pulled the most disgusting face and just said ""no"". No explanation as to why just ""no"". Two men walked in after us and were seated no problem. We were in shock so did not question this and was embarrassed so we left straight away. Also after that treatment I wouldn't spend a penny here. I am guessing from reviews that this restaurant does not like English people as the men after us were not English and had no problems. DO NOT ENTER, absolute snobbery of a place choosing who can and can't have a table at their crappy little pizza place. Disgraceful.",1
Amarone,pietroz869,"September 15, 2016",Child unfriendly. Don't go there,In this restaurant I had my worst customer experience ever. Never had such a poor service. I don't understand how this place can be still opened. My children (5 and 8 years old) walked the stairs up to the upper dining area and the owner / waiter told me that it was not a kindergarden! Then I aplogised and said that maybe he was exagerating. Then he started shouting at me that I should teach good manners to my children... I was in shock. Oh by the way the food is just ordinary. Nothing special.,1

Then decided to give it another try with just one spoon stolen from my son's order...Could help but order one for me too! The food is just excellent. This is traditional Italian cuisine at its best. Take the pizzas for example. Plain, lean, and not too salty. Just like what they are supposed to be. American pizza is good too, but it's more elaborate and has lost its anutenticity. The wine we had was good too, at a reasonable price. The owner-waitress lady is not here to make long speeches about how ""great"" your choice is and is certainly a bit on the grumpy side. But what are fabricated commercial perfect teethed smiles worth anyway? Imagine that the bill was hand written too, and you really feel this is one of a kind most authentic Italian restaurant. There is one thing that should be improved though: even if prices were very reasonable, it should be possible to order free tap water. It was not the case and this is the only minor quibble I have with this place",5

Showed inside by an elderly, charming gentleman. We ordered pizza and our host was very helpful and fair and advised us not to buy a whole pizza for the small one, since it would be a waste, as it would be too much for her. Instead, we shared with her. Our host did not speak much English or Danish, but with the well known charm and openness of the Mediterranean everything went smooth. The pizza was crisp and the ingredients were fresh. Service was fast. A lovely little piece of Italy in the middle of Copenhagen. ",5

Osteriet & Ko,351katjak,"August 9, 2016",Uprofessionel betjening og service,"Vi var første gang afsted for at besøge kødbyen og se dets restauranter. Som osteelsker havde min mand og jeg læst i en annonce at Osteriet og Ko afholdte ostekurser. Vi gik ind i den tomme forretning og der stod en pige og var igang med noget der må have været langt mere vigtigt end at betjene kunder. Da jeg selv henvendte mig til hende og spurgte til kurserne kunne hun lige kort vende sig om og sige at det kørte ikke mere og så vendte hun sig om igen. Jeg spurgte hende derefter om det var noget man ville planlægge i fremtiden hvorefter hun surt sagde at det vidste hun ikke noget om. Vi gik lidt rundt i forretningen og så at det var muligt at få ostetapas med hjem. Vi spurgte ind til hvilke slags/type oste det var man fik. og svaret var ukonkret at det var noget hun havde ""ovre i sit køleskab"" men hun ville ikke vise os det. jeg spurgte igen og igen ukonkret fik vi et hovedrystende svar om at hvis vi ikke kunne lide gedeost fik vi selvfølgelig ikke det med. ikke lige et professionelt svar. Jeg giver denne anmeldelse fordi vi i grunden synes at Osteriet er et rigtigt godt initiativ, men at det er rigtigt ærgerligt når nu det er kvalitets produkter man sælger at man så ikke samtidig sætter velinformeret og servicemindet butikspersonale til at passe butikken.",2

Then i) the waitress said something about 'not sure'; ii) the food served was significantly less interesting than the first time, and iii) I observed another visitor who had ordered 'ordinary set', who got the same food as I had had ordered as 'special set'.

When entering the restaurant the air of the dining room was full of steam (making it a little difficult to breath!) because the cook prepared some special dishes in front of diners who sat around a big round table. The menu looked interesting with lots of traditional Japanese options. However, I was not very impressed by what I had ordered: the Yakitori chicken skewers were bland by taste and did not have a pleasant texture, and the rice in my sushi bits did not hold at all together when dipping it in the soya but crumbled - messy and irritating. On the top of that, the price for a simple starter and basic sushi plus a bottle of non-alcoholic beer was nearly 50 euros which I consider far too high taking into account the mediocre quality. The service was friendly though and I did not need to wait long, but this is not a place I would like to return to or recommend.",2

But getting to the food where the starter was a dull scallop dish supposed to be served with salat, but only fried slightly on the pan and then drowned in some premix sauce brought in a nearby Thai market - my friend had two comments to the dish - would have been nicer with 10 instead of 5 pieces and I am certain that I could have made this better my self. The main dishes was in a more appropriate size had a fried brown/greenish looking noodles dish myself, and my fried a rather nice looking rice dish with duck - a bit salty.

There is a menu offering hot foods as well. I did not see my favorite unagi (eel). It seems they made so many batches and varieties of salmon sushi. The cold duck (yuck!) with hoisin sauce salad was extremely salty. The spicy chicken salad was better. I've eaten in similar type restaurants before and I think its overpriced for the quality (but then again everything in the airport is overpriced!). Even though its a japanese restaurant, I did not see any Japanese workers. Flag or wave to an employee if you need service.",3
YoSushi,thierry-hirtz,"September 12, 2015",High quality and price,"The price is at the level of food quality. It's really a good place for sushi, noodle soup, and other japonese specialities. The system of price by plate color is classical, but the average price/plate should be 6 euros, so if you take 5 places, a soup and a drink, you will pay between 40 and 45 euros, which is expensive for a Airport Sushi.",4

You pay for what you eat based on the colours of the bowls you choo ",5
YoSushi,Mamiya7,"July 12, 2015",Very fresh salmon,"They were cutting the salmon off the carcass as I watched. So, the salmon was extremely fresh. I had more salmon nigiri than anything. It was very good for an airport restaurant, but not on par with the average suishi place in the USA. The selection was not as large as a full-service place. I didn't see any Unagi go by me on conveyor line. The pricing could be a little more prominent. Much of the seating is at the counter, but not much attention from wait staff. My tab was a bit over $50 US which would usually get you a higher grade of experience in the US. For airport food, this is very good among the options available.",4

The waiters started closing and were colecting table clothes and ect. walking around our table, but no one bothered to come and check on us, even they could see I pushed my plate on the side of the table without eating...we had to flag one of them to ask about the check and that was my only chance to tell him that I'm not happy with my meal and I didn't really ate any of it, as it is burned....the answer was I'll tell the chef tomorrow, he is not here now?!

This time we received an offer from Club Öresund, and we decided to have lunch with our Danish friends at M G Petersens Familiehave, which we have only visited once before. A disappointing visit. Service was very, very poor. Waiter took a long time receiving us, attending us, was very reluctant to refill the bread basket, slow to give us attention and the possibility to order more beer and drinks etc. Food was ample, quality OK, but not more. When the check arrived, of course it was incorrect, which our Danish friend noticed. So, all in all, a very disappointing lunch.

The luncheon plate at 200 dkr. contained nearly only industrial food including some horrible, triangular cheeses, the Paris toast at 125 dkr. was barely eatably with its industrial white bread, industrial raw egg, low quality meat (soya-blend?), and industrial pickles. The beer and the wine was ok, but at 56 dkr. for a small half liter of beer 73 dkr. for a quarter of a bottle of house wine - just excessive.

Jin Cheng,TangoDublin,"October 9, 2014",Not Great,We stayed in this area in the first week of September and on our first evening we looked for a restaurant nearby. We only saw two restaurants as we walked from our hotel and decided to go to a Chinese one. When we entered it was reasonably busy with about half the tables occupied . Most people were at the end of their meals we were about fifteen minutes watching vacated tables being reset before or order was taken. Half a hour later we were still waiting for our food. One of the things I like about Chinese restaurants is the normally quick service in most of them. When the food arrived it was not very hot and also the chicken pieces were in a very non crisp coating. It looked as it had been left a long time after it had been cooked before being served. Overall the food was not that great even the desert was small and with little flavour. Prices were average for the area.

Price is in the high end for the brunch, it sounds a lot on the card but it's a small plate. No coffe or water. I think it's too much for this little food. The food it self was not poor quality, it was ok. The cafe is more a bar and some would say it's cozy but a bit to worn down for me.

Cafe Bopa,stephaniebV1859UD,"September 9, 2015",A great mix of a trendy crowd in a community pub,"Cafe Bopa is a favourite haunt of both locals and people working at the many businesses located towards the revamped dockland area nearby. Set in a leafy residential square behind Østerbrogade, you won't find tourists here, only people in 'the know'. You can sit in one of the nooks and crannies of the cosy interior or, weather permitting, sit outside front or back. They have a decent selection of beers and wines and a nice lunch and dinner menu. But the best thing about Bopa, as any local would tell you, are their amazing fries, these are proper chips in the British sense of the word, chunky and crisp and always served with mayonnaise - heaven with a pint of lager.

I was kinda surprised about the bad reviews I saw about it on the net, cause it's a lot better than any other buffet we have been at in Denmark. No it's not a ""fancy night out"" place, but if you like to just enjoy a big, pretty cheap buffet with lots of variations (PLUS dessert, you never get that at other buffets in Denmark) with some half drunk, noisy guests and nice staff, this is the place to go. The chinese buffet has something for everybody, and a lot of sushi. Plus, we once got the running sushi buffet and I asked for vegan sushi, and they made me an entire full plate just for me, and told me I could get even more if I wanted but at that point I was really full.

Restaurant Royal Palace,Gabriela I,"April 21, 2014","For sure the best food and best report quality-price, but some of the employees should learn how to treat clients","I discovered the restaurant through Groupon. I bought a sushi voucher for my friends and they decided to have it together. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, the taste and the appearance of sushi. I liked it so much that I decided to try the restaurant also.First time i went alone. The location is very easy to be reached, just a few meters from Nørreport station. When I entered a smiley waiter welcomed me. The restaurant is divided in 2, at the first floor is the Chinese buffet, and at the ground floor there is the sushi buffet. I chose the sushi and it was the perfect choice. The second time, alone again, I went for the Chinese buffet. Everything very fresh, spicy and tasty. There are plenty of salads, Mongolian barbeque, shrimps, sushi, fruits, pancake and ice cream. Here, at the first floor, the atmosphere is different, the waiters are nice ,smile and focused on the client. A very good ideea is the raw meet, which is grilled quickly just in front of you. The table is cleared as soon as needed and the service is really good. I went the next 3 weekends accompanied by my friend, and everything was ok as a couple also. But...everything changed when I invited my boss there. She came with the kids, they were a bit restless, ( 3 and 5 years).It was late when we went, and a quarter of hour before closing, the waiter from the ground floor came and ask to pay and leave. I found it unpolite, but we did not comment, and we tipped as usual and left, thinking that maybe it was a hard day for them also. Next weekend we went again, I celebrated my birthday there.The bartender (might have been the owner) was nice and friendly as usual, and I was offered a rebate also. Yesterday, being alone on Easter, I thought its a good idea to go there, and so I did. But at the first floor everything was full, so I went downstairs. There there were enough empty tables, so I took place and waited for the waiter to come. She came (the same one who asked us to leave the other night)... and instead of a welcome and a smile, I was requested not to stay to much because they do not really have tables for one person. I mean...the last 3 months I was there every weekend, either alone or with friends and colleagues, I advertised the place and went there every single week. I am very sure that not only regular clients, but all the clients, should be approached in a very different manner. I would still recommend the restaurant for the food, which id the best i had in Copenhagen excepting Nimb, but that one is a different class and different price range, so you can not really compare them. The restaurant is open from 17 to 22 and from 17 to 23 during weekends (for the buffet) and the price is bigger on saturday than in the rest of the days. If you dont mind the rude waiters, go for the running sushi, it worths every korona. If you want both good food and to be pampered, go at the first floor.",4

No customers outside, no customers inside, a faux fire burning away inside, this was the perfect opportunity to get warmed up and to be in and out hassle free. Unfortunately, as much as the Irish coffee was OK, my wife had to ask three times for milk for her tea. Yes, I understand that tea as Brits drink it is not as common place in Denmark, but when the waiter does acknowledge you and says several times he will be right back with the milk, it’s pretty bad. In the end my wife had to hunt down the waiter where she found “he’d forgot”. The tea was cold by the time we got the milk. We should’ve refused to pay, but you know polite Brits etc. This was the only bad experience we had in the whole trip to Copenhagen. ",1

After a bit more shouting, the food came out and was good. When we came to pay the bill, we wanted to pay part cash and part card (we were leaving for the airport homeward bound). The waiter initially took the cash, counted it and then took the card. He was clearly annoyed and when he handed the card machine back he had entered the full amount and refused to take the cash. No explanation, no apology, didn’t even make eye contact. He was clearly irritated. We ate at some great places in Copenhagen, such a shame this was our last one and such a disappointment. ",2

Barock,KimMaximilian,"January 2, 2019",Disappointing from the moment we walked in,"First thing first; All three of us ordered champagne but only two us got it served because they were out of it apparently..and the two glasses we got was flat and super small. Now on to the food.. We got served the lunch menu and ordered from it. When the food arrived the dish that was supposed to be pasta with salmon was switched to salmon with just a tad of pasta on the side, so it was not a pasta dish. Then the cesars salad that were supposed to contain chicken arrived without chicken. My burger was super basic. When we expressed our disappointment they didn’t fix it (add more pasta and chicken). «But you haven’t been charged for the one chicken»..as if that meant any thing. When the bill arrived we were charged for the dinner prices even though we ordered from the lunch menu the waiter brought us. He apologied for letting one of those slip in there, but we all got the same menu so that statement was not correct. We told them we wanted a discount since they totally screwed up our order. Then a half an hour goes by with arguing back and forth - instead of them just taking the blame and giving us a discount and we’d be out of there. Their excuse for not giving it was that the waiter had to pay for it if he gave a discount which is beyond anything I’ve heard about the serving business. Who treats their employees like that? And the worst thing is they inform us so we immediately will feel bad for them and stop nagging them about it. Mistakes DOES happen, we know that, but the lack of service was shocking. The whole thing ended up with us getting a 25% discount on the dinner menu prices which ended up with us paying literally the same as we would for the lunch prices - so the waiter’s tip didn’t get hurt. Ridicilous! They offered champagne to the one without the chicken, but as stated earlier; they were out of it. And me, that didn’t get one in the first place were anyways don’t offered one so it got phony. It seems to us that Nyhavn in general treats tourists however they because they know they probably wont come back anyways. Their only problem is that one of us lives there and the other two of us visit frequently. Therefore it’s disappointing to be treated like that in a city that market themselves with good food. This is not the case in this place. So no, we don’t recommend Barock and Nyhavn in general. It’s beautiful there, but pleace find restaurants other places because this isn’t worth anyone’s time or money. I’m sorry! ",1

Surprise, surprise, they messed up the order and a plate of grilled salmon was served on the table. We asked the waiter again to double check order and he was so sure that was the poached as ordered. I wasn’t happy about it so we took the menu to show him that this is not the poached because it was served with pasta. The poached salmon is supposed to be served with mussels as on menu and for the obvious grilled mark on the fish. He immediately apologized and pathetically said he thought he heard her saying grilled. 5 minutes later, the fish arrived...... the GRILLED fish arrived with mussels on the side. What a joke! Holding things together, we just left things there.... until, we asked for the bill and he couldn’t even be bothered to check before sending it to us.

Barock,Simon B,"August 5, 2017","Avoid, avoid, avoid!",Went here with family and after asking for tap water with food with food order we were ignored. When repeated 10 mins later we were told that they were unwilling (rules) to supply tap water and were under surveillance from their cameras to prevent this. What a load or rubbish! Unhelpful staff so we cancelled the food. They called the police. Extraordinary behaviour from a restaurant over 4 glasses of water. Please do not go to this venue as they are clearly trying to rip off tourists! For info the police were equally unhelpful suggesting we pay or thy would arrest us and our only recourse was suing the restaurant for $150. Further damaging our view of Copenhagen.,1

It's not that the food was bad, it was just unremarkable. We ordered the salmon steak (not a filet which would have been more in tune with the price) that had pasta and some greens on the side. The restaurant should have been embarrassed to serve so little for so much. I'm not kidding when I say the pasta side dish consisted of about 6 fettuccini noodles. The little side dish of tomato sauce was likely poured out of a jar of tomato sauce with no seasoning. We know our Canadian money doesn't go far in Denmark, but the price of this meal for what it was, was astronomical. We were still hungry later so after walking around, we ate again. The most disappointing thing is that when we travel, we hate to waste an eating opportunity!",2

Eventually I went inside to ask someone to take our order, which they eventually & begrudgingly did!

Missed a lot of typical Danish lunch table ""ingredients"". Could not get a platter which included cheese, which MUST end a Danish lunch. Also, we constantly had to ask for more bread - as if they didn't expect people to put the food on the platter on bread. Furthermore the white bread (franskbrød) was in small bits, which were impossible to use under the salmon and shrimps. Would probably try another restaurant further down Nyhavn next time.",4

We took our chance having been assured by friends that prices were high everywhere but it was difficult to find a bad meal in Copenhagen. Fortunately we had not read the reviews on Tripadvisor, and chose Barock, based on the friendly waiter and the look of of outside alcove giving views on the canal. Yes, it was an expensive meal, but in terms of the general area, quite reasonable. We ordered the set menu for my wife, half lobster, beef tornado, medium rare, creme Brûlée with glass of champagne.

Our other vegetarian son was happily catered for with no fuss at all even though there was little in the way of options on the menu. Plates were all cleared by four satisfied customers, and we even asked for more bread it was so nice.

It's not expensive too much, of course compared to others, because almost everywhere is expensive in Kopenhagen. Food is delicious. Especially I liked salmon. Maybe we were very hungry, but the size of the food was not satisfactory. If you prefer to be outside, it is highly recommended to see the inside of the restaurant, it was really barock, we liked it very much.

However on the bill, the smorrebrod was 160 kronor per person. In the UK, this would be illegal. You cannot advertise a price outside then charge more when it comes to it. I asked the waiter about it and he just shrugged and said the signboards outside were old! I wanted some tap water as I have to take tablets with meals at the moment. Nope, no tap water allowed. Just mineral water for 35 kronor a bottle. At first the waiter said that the tap water was 'not good here'. Rubbish! Danish drinking water quality is excellent. Then he said it was the boss's decision to charge for water and there was nothing he could do about it. There are plenty more places further along the Nyhavn. Do not go to this one!",1

I had the fish platter, a sort of taster of a selection of fish. Although rather small it was delicious and gave a good variety and was very nicely prepared and presented. For me, there were two excellent points; there were no additional charges for sitting on the terrace (unlike many places, particularly Venice !) and the location meant I could watch the Copenhagen life going on around me. There was a brilliant clarinet-playing busker who was playing across from where I was which was excellent. In spite of the cold, the two waitresses were wonderfully cheery and polite - I'm sure many others would have been grumpy at having to wait in the cold. And, it wasn't hugely expensive !!

The a la carte menu offered a good choice of dishes and we had the grilled salmon and veal steak . Portions were generous. The salmon was delicious as was the veal steak, and the accompanying dauphinois potatoes and stir fried vegetables were superbly done . The profiteroles deserves special mention and to me rivals those we had in Paris, and certainly large enough to share between two people. We also ordered a selection of French cheeses which included Brie, Comté and Roquefort swerved with prunes and unusually at least for me, olives.

I approached the waitress asking for a table for one person, she just looked at me in an odd way? I don't look unusual so not sure why she looked like that. Then she showed me a table. I made order really quickly, burger with fries and Diet Coke. She took my order, then took the next table's order and then came back to me asking for my order again as though I was a new customer! The order took a long time. She then, after about 20 mins asked the table next to me if they ordered the Diet Coke, then turned and asked me but she said another name for it, when I said I ordered Diet Coke, she corrected me to say it was Coke Zero. When the food came there was not enough if it, I could count the fries, the dish holding the fries was badly chipped. I then had to ask for ketchup, there was nothing on my table, no salt, cutlery, napkin. She brought me 2 sachets of ketchup, like in a fast food restaurant, the napkin was dirty. It was so awful and awkward. I are fast and asked for my bill. She then asked if I wanted to tip get, no I absolutely did not, the food was over priced at 169DKK, the service was slow and awful, and the waitress should not be working with people, ever! I gave her the money and even her return if my change was weird, she just gave it to me like she wanted to throw it at my face, even other customers were watching the way she was dealing with me and I really don't get visibly angry or react so it was her odd/rude behaviour that was attracting this.

When my sole arrived it was pan fried with a light batter accompanied by potatoes and vegetables. When I took my first forkful, I realized I had quite a few bones in my mouth. I chalked it up to it having been an end piece. When I took my second bite, I realized I had even more bones in my mouth. I called the waitress over and asked if the fish was filet, and she said no, you have to do it yourself. When I said that there was a batter on the fish she showed me the fish knife and told me to remove the batter covering and remove the bones. At that point I asked her to please take it back to the kitchen and have them filet it there, which she did. Full disclosure, I do not like bones in my fish dishes and will always order a filet fish. Perhaps this is a cultural thing and this is what they do in Denmark, but I truly do not understand a battered fish which you have to de-bone yourself.

And what a surprise. Excellent service from our waitress, very nice food from the kitchen and reasonable size portions. Don’t know if we would have had the same experience if we’d sat outside. We had one three course set menu steak meal (price 198kr about £22) and one meal a la carte. And for a high prices, high wages and high taxation country (VAT is 25%), the Chilean house wine at 195kr was excellent and not too bad value either. We didn’t even bother to look at the wines on the menu with the silly prices. It sounds like a lot of people have had real bad experiences at Barock, but equally, there must be loads of others, like us, who were very happy with their meals and their service.

My lunch plate consisted of an iconic favorite called ""Stjerneskud"" which is a delightful combination of steamed and fried sole fillets adorned with delicate coldwater shrimp and various pickles and sauce remoulade.Reasonably good bread basket ( could be better). Chilled white wine to accompany . A steady stream of local Danes , holiday makers and hand holding lovers strolling down cobbled Nyhavn on a summers day............what's not to like ! I'll tell you what : the service ! Having lived the better part of my adult life in North America I see clearly how different service concepts are between our two cultures. You can't ask for any modifications to a dish ...........just pay more for anything as an ""extra"". Staff are not supervised at all and seem to meet any inquiry with a ""deer caught in the headlights"" expression. they can even seem a bit rude - definitely stand-off-ish. However, this is a ""general"" problem and this establishment should not bear the blame for it alone. If you persevere a bit you will find that you first must penetrate a veneer of insecurity of some sort everywhere here - and then the willingness to please and the ""true"" mild mannered nature of the Scandinavian will shine through. The food at this bistro/café is quite authentic ( especially the lunch dishes) and a good place to experience an iconic Copenhagen landmark ( Nyhavn) at a fair value ( let's face it : everything is expensive here so the concept of ""value"" is hard to nail down).

When we finally received the starters they weren't complete and when we complained and asked why it took them over 30-45 mins to receive our food the waiter said it was not their fault it's because we switched tables. So I asked did the kitchen stop cooking because we switched seats and he could not explain things so then I asked or is it because we are foreigners and you did not find that it was important enough to be served in your restaurant, he then pointed his fingers at us and said ""Do not dare accuse me of being racist, do not talk to me like that"" the whole time he was pointing his finger furiously at us.

Both fish looked like they had come out of a Findus box and definitely been frozen. The lemon sole was really dry and tasteless, potatoes raw and inedible :0( The waitresses didn't seem to care a monkeys about u, they all moved like snails and had to be asked to clear empty plates after we had sat and looked at them for over twenty minutes. The bill rubbed salt into the wound. A starter and a main for 3 and 1 bottle of house white came to just under 1300- kroner! Ouch! I never mind paying for good food but this was awful. :0(",1

What I received was definitely not a fillet! It was about 1/4 inch thick, was 1/3 fat and sort of reminded me of a rib steak given the marbling throughout.

The choice turned out to be a good one. I have no complaints in reagrds to the service, as we were consistenly happy that folks spoke English. We have no complaints in regards to the food, as what we were served tasted great. I have no complaints in regards to the selection, as we always try to find something truly ""foreign"" when we travel, and their assorted fish plate was just the thing. I WAS consistently unhappy, however, with the exchange rate of the American dollar as everything seemed so very expensive. My serving of pasta was about $33 and consisted of only a very small portion. It would have been fun to have chosen to sit outside, but it was a cold and windy evening so we made a different choice and sat inside. There are so many places which don't have an ""inside"" to turn to, we were happy we had a chance to choose!",4

The interior of the restaurant is very nice, I would say elegant: white tablecloths, candles, old shandeliers....The food was very mediocre. It was much better described in the menu than it was in reality. Drinks were very expensive, even the local Carlsberg beer. Our waitress was well-meaning but helpless and forgetful. On the whole I think it is better to go to Nyhavn during the day (if it is sunny) to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere of a lively habour. For the evening I would recommend restaurants in Kompagnistraede which is parallel to the main pedestrian street on the right.",3

We decided to return on a Thursday night to avail of their 'happy hour' offer in relation to two cocktails for 100 kroner. Unfortunately, we were overcharged for our drinks as it was not made clear to us that both cocktails we ordered had to be the same. Nowhere on the menu did they display this condition and we were denied the full tab before ordering our second round so we had no idea of the situation. To add to this, despite ordering 2 sets of the same drinks throughout the night, we were still not charged the reduced price but rather the full price. On another note the service was not particularly efficient, which we would have happily overlooked had we been charged the correct tab. I would recommend that fellow tourists avoid the place as it feels as the staff took advantage of the language barrier. ",1

However, this sunday noon (1200am) it is more like a battlefield than a couzy café: The buffet is right inside the doorway, so you conflict with the customers queing up for the buffét, service is NON-EXCISTING as the few people employed there are running somewhat confused around with patching tasks, and you will have to find a seat yourself. The worse part is the buffet food itself: Trays of all-kinds-from a-tin is mixed and plated up on too small serving trays, meaning that everything runs out very fast due to the que line, there is not much left for the remaining que and people are constantly asking for more to eat and fill up of these, youghurt, bread, whatever. The quality of food os LOUSY to say the least: All warm items are pre-heated from frozen and looks directly disgusting, ""salads"" are ususally frozen prawns, vegetables from tins and or mayonnaise / oil mixed in. Two (2) large bowl of Olives (why?), two large bowl of small quebed Feta cheese (why?...again), courges(?) in tomata salsa and schredded wjite cabbage in more oil (WHY!?)

Vapiano Tivoli,Pippa B,"May 31, 2019",Overcharged us by over £30 and tried to cover it up,"Great food but when we came to pay, the meal seemed a lot (£71) as we had only had one adult pasta, one salad, two kids pasta and 2 small glasses of wine. I queried the amount and was told 'it's fine' but when I asked for the receipt the 2 glasses of wine were over £20 each!. I queried this and was told that 'her hand had slipped twice when she pressed the button' and she charged us for 2 bottles of wine instead. Each glass of wine was just over £5 each so we were overcharged over £30 for the 2 glasses of wine. They refused to refund the £30 to the card and reluctantly gave me cash. However, they didn't see what the problem was! I think the manager (she refused to refund me how I had paid) and the bar manager were scamming tourists.",1

Sounded odd. As we walked up the stairs we figured this meant we'd be standing for 40 minutes since there was a 40 minute wait for food. We were right. Upstairs was chaos with several queues. I fancied pasta and my partner fancied pizza. These were separated which meant that we probably wouldn't be served together and hence wouldn't eat together. There were no menus so we had no idea what we could order. People were wondering around with trays of food looking for seats. We decided to leave and chose a different restaurant. ",1

Tap your card on a sensor machine to record your order. Payment is made as you exit the restaurant. The food is average and reasonably price, relative to lots of other restaurants in the vicinity.

I hadn't come across this concept before where you collect a card on entry, then go to various counters to get your food and drink, use the card and pay for it all at the desk on exit. All good in theory. However, if you've got a group who all want to eat different types of food, it doesn't really work at all. If you wanted a pasta dish (which half of our party did), then you go up to the counter and get it straight away. However, if you want a pizza or lasagne which the rest of us did, you have to wait a long time. By the time we got our pizzas and lasagne, the rest of the group had finished eating a long time ago. The pizzas take longer than you'd expect in a normal Italian restaurant. The food was fine but nothing special. those who had pizza complained of a lack of cheese! It's expensive but I suppose that's just because it's Copenhagen but I wouldn't eat at one of these places again.",3
Vapiano Tivoli,goer33,"September 25, 2018","Convenient, Initially Confusing, Generally Average","Located on the corner of the Tivoli, this restaurant is very convenient to the Radisson Royal Hotel and the many others in the neighborhood. It was its location and the fact that it was Italian that prompted us to decide to eat at Vapiano. We were unfamiliar with the chain or its philosophy -- which seems to have as much to do with lifestyle as food -- and had not read reviews. Nor did we have any knowledge of the restaurant 's concept. This review is intended to assist others thinking of going for the first time. The idea, apparently, is to be given a card necessary for ordering upon entering. However, nobody gave us a card so were mystified when we walked over to the ordering line. I asked one of the chefs what was going on. A staff member then handed my wife and myself a card each. There are different lines for different items, pizza, pasta, etc. You place your card on a reader where it records what you order and the price. Prices do not appear on the chain's website menu ",3

I don’t understand why they do not take the order and call you when it’s ready. Here, the chef at the live counter takes your order, makes your pasta and serves you while the rest are standing in the queue behind you.

The concept of having a chef cooking food to order in front of the customer is interesting, but when it gets busy and there are 4 members in a group that want to eat together, it becomes an issue. Fortunately we had some time that day, so we ate when our food was fresh and waited for the others to eat. My husband and I ordered fresh pasta dishes and they were delicious. I had shrimp pasta with mushrooms and onions. He had chicken pasta with mixed vegetables. We asked for bread and the chef complied. I'm not sure if there would normally be an extra charge, but since we had paid when we ordered, he didn't say anything. It was expensive, but we had come to the realization that most restaurants in tourist areas of Copenhagen were fairly high priced. The restaurant was clean and very modern, so it was a pleasant place to be. The living wall of succulent plants was very attractive.",4

Why? Because we love Vapiano and we visit Vapiano in Malmø on a monthly basis and therefore was soo excited that Vapiano finally had arrived to Denmark. That is why it was even more painful that Vapiano did not live up to our expectation. Our Pizza was burned, the Shrimp Caesar Salad had half the amount of shrimps than we normally have in other Vapiano Restaurants and finally the bruschetta was made with cold refrigerator tomatoes on small pieces of bread. I know that Vapiano is new to Copenhagen so hopefully they will come around and get their act together and do as well as other Vapiano Restaurants does abroad. Might be a good idea to have a a Supervising Restaurant Manager come from another Vapiano Restaurant too help them start up.",1

Visiting Copenhagen we saw a new Vapiano located at the 'Tivoli' corner on the first floor. We decided to try, and got the menu from the nice lady in the entrance and then climbed the stairs to the restaurant on the first floor. We were met by the nicest furbished and decorated Vapiano we have ever seen. Big rooms tastefully furbished with modern and new interior with at variety of table in different lay-outs and all with great view. The format of this Vapiano is the same as for others, and we entered the line in front of 'pasta' and ordered Scampi e Spinachi with chilli. The home made pasta was cooked to perfection and so was the rest of the raw materials and the taste was great. While dining we could charge our smartphones on the new air chargers located at every table, and we had access to the latests new posh food and design magazine. This is the best Vapiano we have ever visited, with the best interior, atmosphere, ambience and location and the food was great as always.

Vapiano Tivoli,coombsmandy,"January 6, 2018",Different eating concept -loved it!,"Went here with English & Danish friends. Very busy, but good service. You get given a card when you arrive, then you find a table, go to the bar for your drinks and add them to the card, then you get in the starter queue & order what you want, the food is all cooked freshly in front of you, so you wait then take it back to your table to eat. When you’re done you go to the pasta or pizza queue & do the same. If the wait is a bit longer you get given a buzzer, so you can return to your table and wait until you’re buzzed. Food is added to your card the same as the drinks. The queues were short & quick, the staff friendly & cleared the table quickly. While you are there you can keep adding things to your card, then you just pay when you leave. A different experience & a pretty efficient way of ordering etc. You may be given more than one card when you enter as you can only put so much onto each on ",4

As I was about to order, the waiter insisted that I had to buy a drink (not included in the buffet), but I told him, my wife had already ordered for me. He said that it was a requirement to be able to buy a buffet, to pay for a beverage. I was of course offended and asked what's the cheapest. Tap water: 20 dkr. That is simply illegal in Denmark. They should at least change their big banner and say Buffet only 69 + at least 20 for tap water. But they probably can't because they might get aressted.

The offer was to sit on the outside deck and I asked if it is covered and warm there as we come in December and Maybe there will be snow or rain. They wrote that we can be sure that it will be warm and comfortable. When we arrived there was nothing prepared and we had to sit at two separate tables - 1x4 and 1x10 pax. The 4 pax had to take a table at the side of the outside deck where it was windy and wet behause it was raining. There was only a small heater in the middle of the deck and the people sitting at the End of the table could not profit from it. It was really a mess! After discussing with the staff we had to wait app 30 minutes and could then go inside where it was warm and cosy. We got 2 tables - 6 and 8 pax. Better than outside anyway. Food was quite good but poor service. It was hard to get more than one Drink, the first order was Not complete, they forgot to bring napkins and cutlery. New arrived guests next to us were sitting 20 minutes and went away without having had the Chance to order something. Overall very bad organization.

I do not fault her, she was obviously working hard and overwhelmed. However, the amount of time it took to order and then get our food was extreme.

We got the large appetizer plank to share and while most was tasty, it did taste slightly reheated and generic. As others have said there are so many amazing options for food in the park, unless you really want the experience of eating on the ship (which is awesome!) I would say to try somewhere else. ",4

Pleasant waiting staff wearing pirate type dresses etc. We had the mixed starters which were okay. From a very small menu we all chose chicken skewers. Each skewer had three moderately sized pieces of chicken, three bits of pineapple and three bits of pepper. Below this was some raw cabbage type salad. This came with a plate of chips between us (quite nice) and a bowl of salad which was mainly raw cabbage again. Dearer than even dear Copenhagen prices - as you would expect - they could still make a better effort with the food. However, it was a pleasant place to eat with good service. I would choose one of the many stalls to eat here - cheaper and then you could walk around the magic of Tivoli.",3

There is an animated pirate greeting you as you walk the plank into the restaurant. As with everything else inside the Tivoli, expect to pay a premium for food. I wanted to order a starter but was told I had to select 3 items for 110DKK. I asked for the sardines in hot sauce and to my surprise, I was served a can of sardines with the lid half open and a bottle of habanero sauce!! The chorizo appetizer was a Danish sausage served with a chorizo paste. We also had a pork skewer. I did not like it very much but my son ate most of it. The good part was that the pork skewer was served with family size salad and fries. So we could all dip into these items.

We all ordered hot sandwiches, I had one with chicken and flatbread which was fine, nothing out of this world but still tasty. The main winner for me was the potatoes which came in a huge basket and were absolutely delicious. Soft and melty in the middle but crispy and tasty on the outside. Like roast potatoes. Lovely. The wine was also good of course. There were opportunities to dress up as a pirate if you wished to and the setting was quite fun - looking out of a porthole whilst enjoying lunch.

This restaurant used to be ok with mixed grill platters of decent sizes, so it was very disappointing to discover that the standard had dropped to an appalling level. The adult portion was an utter joke. Priced at 110 kroner, it consisted of one single skewer with 2 tiny (2x2 cm) pieces of chicken on a small bed of lettuce and a flatbread, and some burned potatos. The adult portion was actually smaller than a starter. And when I pointed this out to the waiter, he laughed at me and walked away. The burger from the child menu was actually larger than the adult portion. This place is appalling and they ought to be ashamed of themselves ripping customers off like that.

We ordered the spicy chicken wings to start, a parma pizza with extra pepperoni and a calzone. After waiting 30 minutes our mains came, but no chicken wings. We asked where they were, and she said she had put the ticket with wings through first and that had confused the kitchen!!! How can a starter confuse a kitchen?? She then brought them to our table well after we were half way through our pizzas. The wings were clearly cooked in the microwave, soggy and totally tasteless. The pizza I had did not come with the extra pepperoni and was like cardboard and didn't taste of anything at all. My partner's calzone had a small lump of filling right in the middle and it was basically just very dry dough. We left half the food, paid the bill and left - never to return again. It's a joke!!",1

The staff weren't really friendly or apologetic about it but it's fine, I knew there was only a small chance I could change my mind. Either way, that was fine, not a big deal. The food was pretty awful though, I chose a Mediterranean pizza, the ingredients weren't fresh at all, no fresh herbs or any kind of flavour and the only ""mediterranean"" vegetarian was a pepper, nothing else.

I pointed out to the nearest server that the food was not as described and not what I wanted; he refused to apologize, saying I had to wait for my server to come around, and then went off, poured himself a drink, greeted his buddy who entered the restaurant, and was unavailable.

It was not very late but we sat down outside Nova and after waiting for 10 minutes for service we were just about to go inside and find someone when a waiter appeared. We ordered four drinks and were told we had to pay fo them as soon as they arrived because we were not eating anything. We did so. Just as we leaving we looked again at the bill as it had seemed a bit expensive for what we had and saw that we had been charged for a chicken Caesar salad as well as the drinks. One of us went in to ask for the money back but the waiter was hesitant and suggested we had some more drinks instead. We said no thanks and he said he would have to speak to the duty manager. When he came out to us he repeated that we could have more drinks but that he could not refund the money. We again insisted that we wanted a refund and he was very grumpy and said he would have to talk to the chef again. Eventually he came out and almost threw the exact money (68k) on the table. No apology for the error at any stage of the whole episode. I see another reviewer mentions something similar so I suggest you check your bill if you go here. I cannot recommend the place due to the unacceptable attitude of the waiter we had.,1

Myself and a colleague arrived without a reservation after walking around the area looking for somewhere to eat. We were shown to a table quickly and looked after by a lovely waitress who was smiling, polite and friendly and seemed to be enjoying her job. I opted for Nachos followed by Steak, all of which were great and hot and fresh. My only very slight issue was the Beer could have been better, but was still drinkable. The food definately makes this place worth visiting.",4

Waiter was very engaging and showed us to a good table - even though we had no booking. He was very helpful throughout - and the wine (Amerone) although a bit pricey was great. Food was very nice and I would recommend this as a good place to drop in and enjoy. Thanks to our waiter who I think was a boxer as well. ,4

The place looked like an Italian restaurant but the menu list looked like a hodgepodge of Italian, American and Mexican cuisine (couldn't decide on a particular cuisine, eh?). The waiter initially was nice and accommodating. Food was so-so, nothing special, really. After we paid our bill and left, I reviewed the bill and saw that we were charged for one item (the most expensive one on the bill!) that we did not order.

Restaurant Nova,CatzandMike,"September 25, 2016",Affordable lunch menu,We happened upon Nova as we wandered the maze of streets in city centre late afternoon.

We noticed another table had the burrito and the fish specials- which were presented very nicely. It is on a pleasant side street next to a busy shopping area. Wait staff was nicely attentive.,4

Restaurant Nova,SuffolkClaud,"August 2, 2016",Large outside eating area,Came across this restaurant whilst out looking for somewhere to eat dinner whilst in Copenhagen alone. The large outdoor eating area was busy and relaxed which was exactly what I wa looking for. Was soon shown a table beside a heater which I was thankful for as it was getting quite chilly. I was given a menu and I ordered a beer. I then waited a good 15 minutes before the beer arrived and anyone came to take my food order. It was then another 40 minutes before before my starter arrived and probably the same getting my main. The menu was quite varied and the food was pretty good. By Copenhage standards it was also reasonable value. Just a pity it was spoiled by the bad service.,3

The table behind us had a similar problem. They had to wait a very long time for their tuna steak and beef steak and the kitchen managed to inverse the cooking time for both. No need to say how happy they were... I saw at least 2 more tables where things went wrong. Bad organisation, bad management, bad service.",1

Restaurant Nova,RealTravelWhispers,"July 2, 2016",Decent Lunch Place,Nova is located directly behind Vor Frue Kirche cathedral and has an attractive indoor area and a large outdoor dining terrace.

The waitress was not very service minded or apologetic about the situation. We had to ask several times to hear when the food was coming. We were almost going to walk from the bill after waiting for even longer to get the bill. Definitely not worth a visit. It is a tourist trap with bad service and boring food.,1

The waiter said they only have water in bottles so we decided not to take it. When waiting for our drinks they had a misundestanding about water in the next table as they also had tap water in a jug but the waiter had charged on it. When the waiter saw that we were looking at them he told us that we could get water on the house. When the food arrived it was okay (chicken burrito for me and a pizza for my boyfriend) but in the middle of it my boyfriend realized that something was missing from his pizza. We checked the menu and there should've been rocket salad and cherry tomatos in it. We asked the waiter about it and he said he could now put them on the pizza. We asked if we could get discount instead, and the waiter said that ""he couldn't give any discount as it would go from his pocket and he's a waiter and he already gave us the water for free"". So he put the rocket salad and cherry tomatos on the pizza. The rocket salad tasted like a herbicide or petrol so my boyfriend didn't want to eat it anymore. When the waiter came to take our plates away and we told him what the rocket salad tasted like, he said that that's what rocket salad is supposed to taste like (don't think so, we know what it should taste like...).

Restaurant Nova,morl8tr,"December 30, 2015",This one is for the tourists...,"The sign says they are an Italian-Mexican restaurant. That should be your first clue. We stopped in for a light lunch, was not very crowded. Had a two-for-one cocktails special on, so we tried the margaritas (Mexican, right?). Another clue was when the waitress didn't seem to know the difference between ""on the rocks"" and ""frozen."" Then she assumed we wanted strawberry margarita (Nooooo!), though we caught her on that. The margaritas arrived frozen, apparently the only way that they do them, probably from a machine. They were okay, not the worst I've ever had, but far from the best. The plate of nachos we ordered was large and fairly tasty. A cheap lunch buffet was drawing most people into the restaurant. We didn't go for it, but from the looks of it, it was more oriented to volume of food that taste or quality. The kind of buffet that includes chips and salsa, pasta with a generic red sauce, as well as low end supposed sushi. Copenhagen has so, so much more to offer, food wise than this. Do yourself a favour and go to someplace more interesting.",2

Pizza/pasta, Sushi, Mexican, Burgers, various fish dishes as well as more traditional steaks etc. I have usually found that the bigger the menu, the poorer the food. This was an exception to that rule. The sushi was great (my two children always choose it when they can). My Mexican fajitas were good and almost a meal for two. My wife had fish and she was impressed at how perfectly cooked it was. The only thing that let it down was the service. Our waiter was pleasant, but so clearly overworked having way too many tables to serve. When we had the temerity to ask for cutlery and more drinks from a rather surly member of staff (who just seemed to be ambling about) all he did was bark orders at our already overworked waiter. Consequently the time to get drinks, cutlery, food bill etc. was rather too long to make this an enjoyable experience. Its reasonable value for a Copenhagen tourist spot and in my view way better than the Italian across the road which we went to the following night.

Once we got to ordering we were told the Sushi chef had already gone home so had to order something else. We should have left to find somewhere else but for some reason decided to stay. Bad decision! While waiting for our food we were witness to our waiter (the only waiter in the fairly large restaurant) having an argument with his boss about leaving as he had worked the day shift and nobody had come in to replace him for the night shift. The food we did receive was bland and flavourless. The food was fairly expensive as well. If I'm ever in Copenhagen again I know where not to go now.,1
Restaurant Nova,Cleo03,"May 26, 2014",Waiter avoiding eye contact,"So slow I`ll never go back ! Out for a saturday evening meal, lovely weather, sat outside and waited an hour for 2 pasta dishes and 2 steak dishes, one had a baked potatoe gone black served to us. Waiter came twice with a basket of bread with salsa on to ""compensate"" for the delay, otherwise no explanation given as why it was so long. It was also overpriced for the portion size, I am used to Copenhagen city prices, this was seriously overpriced. A pity because its location in an old part of the city deserves more. By the time we left our waiter was avoiding eye contact, not his fault they have some serious management problems in Nova.",2

We sat there for about 20 minutes waiting for someone to come ask for our order. That didn’t happen however, so I eventually went up to ask to be served. I assume the man I was speaking to was a runner and got us our waiter. Now I was a little upset until I realized that this poor waiter is the only waiter that’s serving the outside area which is about 20 tables if not more, and all these tables at a minimum of 2 people. So I think the management could really do something about that cause that isn’t fair for anyone, some people won’t under that he is working by himself and will just be pissed off and I was too until I started observing what was going on. He also had a lot of tables with 4+ people and he paid more attention to those for obvious reasons, than he did to 2 seaters. I ordered the chefs recommendation which was a seafood pasta and my man got the chicken Alfredo. I’m a lover of seafood and I had been craving it for so long and I must say I was HIGHLY disappointed with the food. It was a bit cold which I wasn’t really mad about, but the squid just tasted 100% off, and I could just taste that it’s not only not fresh but this was that frozen stuff you get from the supermarket. It was definitely inedible and therefore I didn’t eat any of the seafood in fear of getting sick.

We were in a hurry, so we ate the parts which were eatable and asked for the bill. When asked if we liked the food we told the waiter what was wrong and he offered to get new pizzas. We declined since we did not have the time to wait another 30 minutes for replacement. While waiting for the food, we saw many people leaving after nobody attended to them. Some of the waiters are very friendly and service minded, while others are careless and lazy. There are so many great places to eat in Copenhagen, so do yourself a favour and stay away from this place.",1

As just one example, the antipasto was supposed to have mortadella and instead came with a artificially processed and re-constituted non-eatable something (probably pretended to be turkey). When I informed the waiter that that wasn't mortadella, the reply was ""are you sure?""...! My colleague had squid rings that were evidently frozen. As main course I took pasta with seafood (the one suggested by the chef according to the menu). The shrimps were old and overcooked and the rest looked very artificial. Pasta was over-over-over cooked and was falling into pieces. As coronation of the dinner we were asked to pay fast since the waiter had to leave.. wine list is very limited.

There were a lot of dishes to choose from and we decided on starters of chicken and cheese nachos and calamari. When the food arrived it was really good. The calamari was obviously freshly cooked and there was a good amount of chicken with the nachos. The pepperoni pizza I had for my main meal left a bit to be desired as it was very dry and there were not enough chillies. When I asked for more I got chilli flakes and I added some olive oil to the pizza and it turned it from just okay to very nice - it really needed the extras I added. Service was very good too and I tipped the waiter as he did a good job.

But the food is not bad - very normal dishes. The waiter did not overcharge us or lie to us, contrary to what the latest reviews said. However, service is slow, but we were in no rush.

The sign in the front door said otherwise and we had the promotion the day before! The grand finale was when she said: you had promotion yesterday because it was o holyday! Even the waiters stared at her in disbelief. She made up a holiday on the spot!

Was told to find a table yourself then we became invisible for 15 min, no menu no server nothing. When we began to wonder if we should leave a young guy finally came to deliver the menu. It’s happy hour time so we ordered several drinks using the happy hour price. Food was ok but very minimal service, if any. At one point we asked for a couple of plates and it’s not delivered until we finished all the food: the young waiter said he forgot! Then we asked for the bill and a drink was charged at regular price, we inquired and the young guy said we had to specify and asked for that price when we placed the order, which was not specified anywhere on the menu plus the other two drinks were at happy hour price. Didn’t want to argue as we were extremely fed up with the service so we just paid and left. It made Copenhagen look really bad as it’s a tourist area and they would use every means to rip off the tourist, what a shame!",1

Around 8 PM on cold Monday evening the restaurant was half full. We were welcomed by polite young waiters and seated near the window- very romantic table. Outdoor seating area also looked very warm and cozy, again half full. We were not in hurry, but service was prompt, food - pizza and chicken fillet- tasty and nicely presented. Definitely romantic place, reasonable for the center of Copenhagen prices and pleasant young staff. And of course our favorite Latin touch in everything. Spent 2,5 hours there and would stay more....

Fries were fine but thick ones so not French, and broccoli was difficult to find on my plate. As a desert ordered three different coupes of ice but didn’t get what I ordered because they ran out of one taste of ice cream. Unfortunately they didn’t come back to me to tell me upfront but just served something else. When paying in the end, a tip was automatically added when paying by card which is strange. A tip is meant to be discretionary and I was not planning to give one after this experience. Staff was helpful in itself but couldn’t compensate for the poor experience.",2

The waiters were very good and enjoyed a little bit of fun with the customers. Being in Copenhagen we expected our meal to be quite expensive but we were pleasantly surprised when we received our bill that it was only the equivalent of €25 each including a tip and a HUGE beer each.

We said we were good with tap water. We can’t give you tap water you have to pay for water. After a surprised discussion we ordered a bottle of water for the table.

When our starters arrived i got a dry and cold piece of baguette with barely any tomato on my tomatobrushetta. Another starter was the avocadoshrimp cocktail where the food looked distasteful and infact seemed to not be flavoured at all with any spices. For mains we ordered moules frites and three pasta dishes. The moules frites was cold and the the surface was dry, you could tell that this had not been freashly made. Both the sause and pommes frites was cold. Two of the pasta dishes was vegetarian but dispite this we found shrimpes in both our pasta dishes. In addition the pasta was barely warm. The third pasta fish was tasteless and didn’t even seem to have been salted. As the moules frites was cold we sent it back and ordered pizza instead. When the pizza arrived it was not really warm and took a good 30 mins to get. This resulted in my company not beeing able to eat together at the same time. During the whole dinner our waiter didn’t ask us once If the food was good or If we ware satisfied. And finally we found a piece of hair in one of the pizzas. We informed the waiter about our bad experience and yet she did not offer to compensate us in any kind of Way. This shure was the worst restaurant experience we ever had.",1

Mama Rosa,Mantonites,"March 28, 2018",Dinner ,Took my family there for a nice dinner. However apparently between the two servers neither one actually wanted to wait on us. Nobody asked us for a drink order so I finally asked if we could get water. Then try to place our order. So then we get our food. Not terribly hot very dry pasta (must've been low on sauce) then nobody comes to see if all is well. We gave up finally asked for the check. Finally one server says was everything thing ok and I explained the problem with the food and that the top fell off the pepper and dumped pepper in my granddaughters pasta. She says oh can I get you a coffee!? We paid.. No tip. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone,1

Mama Rosa,LVMUSA,"March 17, 2018",Avoid This Place,"We were staying in a nice place across the street from here and the warm outdoor seating drew us in. I should have looked at Trip Advisor before having our last dinner in Copenhagen here. The food was terrible! We had four people in our group and all four of us had our worst meal here. The food came out cold and was terrible, the service was terrible as well. They couldn't even make a decent simple salad. In all the place we ate in Copenhagen this was the only place where we felt like they were trying to rip us off. We had a drink out on the street before eating and the waiter was pretty aggressive to get a tip. And to top it all off, after we had dinner indoors the waiter gave us our bill in Dutch(which no other restaurant did) and he was too difficult to communicate with so we paid our bill and left. I could see that he had a tip included on the bill which is not their custom. Anyhow do not be fooled by the warm charming look of this restaurant. Go some where else--there are so many fantastic restaurants in Copenhagen.",2
Mama Rosa,Blanka L,"March 15, 2018",Our first nice surprising evening in Copenhagen,"Due to be very hungry we were so happy to eat here without reservation. In Copenhagen is big problem to find place without reservation for dinner. That is why we chose the pizza restaurant in the centre. We were nice surprised. The restaurant is not very cheap however I really recommend it. Generally, in Copenhagen we have no chance to find the cheap one as long as you choose the burger restaurant. And 75 cl Carslberg someting unique to thirst.",5
Mama Rosa,702lesleyf,"March 12, 2018",Enjoyed a family meal,"I'm a bit surprised to see so many bad reviews of this restaurant considering the nice meal we had here, but if I had to guess, I'd say it could largely depend on what time of day you're eating here. It's a large place right on the main pedestrian shopping street, so I would imagine it gets very busy at times. We came to eat at about 3pm, so there weren't too many others in the place. Our waitress was friendly, and the food was tasty - pizza, spaghetti, and bruschetta. The desserts and hot chocolates were sort of ""meh"" but not bad.",4
Mama Rosa,ChicagoNorway2008,"February 23, 2018",Do not eat here,"Unfortunately, we did not read reviews before going to this restaurant. But after the bad experience, it is amazing how so many others had the same bad experience. We are not demanding, high-maintenance people at all, and, in fact, this is the first bad review I have ever given...After receiving poor service, and really bad food, the waiter tricked us into tipping him. Keep in mind that tipping is unusual and rare in Copenhagen. After reading other reviews, we see that many others were either pressured or tricked into tipping.

This was rectified, but alas, it did not leave a good impression. And later that evening in our hotel room, we discovered that we had been billed more than we should have been. In other words: do not recommend, and avoid this place = it's a tourist trap. ",2
Mama Rosa,kostasn860,"June 27, 2017",Excellent choice - real food,"Had some great tasting and fulfilling burgers, as well as some chicken rice - all at solid, tasty rations. Highly recommended if you're looking for decent meals and reasonable prices. One remark: why does it take so long for the plates to arrive?",4
Mama Rosa,rakelmaria93,"June 26, 2017",Most tasteless food i have ever tasted,"We came here because it was well located for tourists and had a great big menu. Everything on the menu looked so good. We ordered the cod with lobster sauce and the chili steak. Both our meals were the least to say terrible ! The cod was so dry and had no taste at all , worst i have tasted ever without a doubt , the steak was ok cooked but just as tasteless and it was filled with fat and the meat was just not good. Service wasnt good eather , you had to reach for it if you wanted somerhing. Would deffinetally not recomend ",1
Mama Rosa,tber,"June 26, 2017","Great lunchtime specials, good service","Stopped on our way and enjoyed some meals from their luncheon menu tucked in the middle of the regular menu. 2 pizzas, 1 fish and chips - half the price of the regular menu items and delicious. Great service, price was more than fair and we enjoyed people watching from our great outdoor table. Not sure we would have been as impressed paying nearly double for the entrees (regular menu price) but perfect lunch stop in a sunny afternoon. ",3
Mama Rosa,alikh_26,"June 22, 2017",Great food !! ,"Love mama rossa! Have been there on all my 3 short visits to Copenhagen! 
Great food, with a wide variety for all tastes, in a great location! 
Friendly staff & great wine!",5
Mama Rosa,William H,"June 17, 2017",Excellent food and service,"The look of the restaurant and the food that people were eating first caught my eye (i.e., clean, nice tables, and a bunch of people seated). Service was professional and friendly. I had a nice Danish beer, an amazing 4 cheese pizza w/mushrooms, and finished up with a cappuccino.",5
Mama Rosa,Mike B,"June 11, 2017","Fabulous food, wonderful service","The owner greets guests as they walk by. He felt sorry for me beacause I was rtraveling with 3 women. ""You have 3 wives. I give you special table,"" He did, outside with heat lamps and blankets. Lots of good people watching. Food, service and value were top notch. One of my high points for Copenhagen.",5
Mama Rosa,MikePeo_in_JHB,"June 4, 2017",Expensive tourist trap,"Very expensive for the quality of food presented (completely tasteless) and rude and inattentive service. Location and facade look good - but beware. In the time I spent eating my meal, at least three tables just abandoned the process and left the restaurant. On family was served their pizzas !! exactly one hour after placing the orders! Avoid!",1
Mama Rosa,Domieszter,"June 3, 2017",tourist trap,"We were looking for a nice place in the city centre and found Mama Rosa,an elderly gentlemen invited us in. Then we waited 30 minutes for someone to take our orders another 45 for our food. The pasta was overcooked as well and the prices were super expensive for the quality....avoid ...there are better places in the area for sure",2
Mama Rosa,Eki_Karlsson,"June 1, 2017",Excellent service and good food,"Italian gentleman waiters' service was fast and luxerious. I ate chicken enchilladas, which was good.",5
Mama Rosa,conrad57,"May 27, 2017",Quality meals and value for money in this so called rather expensive city,"We were in Copenhagen for the Marathon and city trip. Being warned for this expensive city we were rather sceptic to find a good place to enjoy our diners. Surprised to find this quality Italian restaurant in the busy shopping area and tourist center of the city. Price of Italian food and Danish beer were fair and we enjoyed it so much we went back for the two follow up dinners during our stay. Staff is helpfull and professional. PS: In Danmark, when you order draft Danish Carlsberg beer, prices are more that acceptable! You will be surprised about what you can order at fair prices in this restaurant. Busy place, street terrace is more enjoyable then inside the restaurant because one can see touriste and shoppers passing by. Place to be!",5
Mama Rosa,Priti14,"May 25, 2017",Excellent food ,We asked for pure vegetarian food . They took care to make the changes and the staff was very courteous.,5
Mama Rosa,ITJuggler,"May 23, 2017","Food just about OK but untidy service, noisy, nothing special.","I thought this looked OK but we hadn't researched. Now I have I realize there are two TripAdvisor entries one for Mama Rosa and another for New Mama Rosa. Many of the pictures are of an older restaurant so perhaps new decorations and new owners. The address is the same so I wonder why. Anyway food was far from delicate, spaghetti was heavy and over cooked in several dishes. Sauce was too think we ended up feeling uncomfortable. Service was chaotic at best, missed orders and forgotten items, including the wine, the excuse was ""we couldn't find it"". Most strange. However the worst was the guy in charge, he bullied and hassled his staff for the whole meal, often shouting and looked very grumpy with everything. He wore a bright silk(?) blue shirt on the night we were there so you could not miss him. Also very unpleasant was sitting inside which was very loud, the crockery was cleared away with food being scrapped off in sight and only 2 or 3 meters from people trying to relax and eat. It was very unpleasant and dark. Not recommended if you are going inside. Outside, I would not bother.",2
Mama Rosa,Hanni_LR43,"May 23, 2017",Nice Italian atmosphere,"Had a go at the New Mama Rosa. I was seated at a table with the view to the outside seating and the walking street. All very nice newly refurbished. But then to the menu which was very big. There were a lot of dishes containing cheese, like pizza and pastas as is what can be expected in an Italian restaurant, and heated cheese does not go down very well with me. So by the help of the owner we searched the menu to find something which I would enjoy. He was most helpful and so was the rest of the staff. I ended up having a Salmon salad with avocados, tomatoes, cucumber and red onions. It was served with bread at the side. Together with a glass of Tebaldo bianco it went down very well. For dessert I had a very nice Tiramisu. I came away from the New Mama Rosa feeling as if I had been at an Italian family gathering, having been looked after so well by all the staff here.",4

Burger Palace,Anders A,"October 7, 2018",A place for local gangsters ;-),This is not a restaurant. But a simple burgerbar where you can sit. Known for its late hours open and thereby attracting drunk people on their way home. The food is not worth mentioning. More the staff/management. They seems to be so uninterested in you as a guest. ,2
Burger Palace,PushExplore,"June 20, 2018",Nice burgers and pizzas ,The Burger Palace is a local chain of burger and pizzeria. Nice service and the size of the portions are quite good. The place needs a bit of a renovation as the seats (couch) are all worn ou ,4
Burger Palace,Nataliajofre,"May 7, 2018","Open late, great pizza","This was the only place open late, we’ll past 11pm near our hotel which was in the middle of downtown Copenhaven. There were a lot of bars open, but no food. We were delightfully surprised by how good this pizza was. The crust was super thin and the cheese was super good. We got the 4 cheese pizza, highly recommended!",5
Burger Palace,Lakers2011,"July 13, 2017",Good late night snack,We got a sandwich here and it was very good.  It was better than we expected and would recommend this place to anyone near the area.,4
Burger Palace,MortenKI,"April 9, 2017",Okay hangover burger.,"If you are looking for a burger of high quality go somewhere else, if you are looking quick fix for your hangover go here. They have fairly large selection of burgers and pizza and at fair prices. But the quality is not great and the most part of the burger is made from industrial produced food.",3
Burger Palace,crgee,"August 1, 2015","Great pizza, delivered to our hotel. ","Our hotel restaurants were closed for the evening and we were starving. Luckily the reception chap told us he could order us something and recommended the Burger Palace. We ordered three pizzas (mine was New York) which were delicious, delivered quickly and still hot. The cost of delivery was also very reasonable. No questions where I'd like to get my food next time in such situation in Copenhagen. ",5
Burger Palace,226danielles,"July 20, 2015",Good food and friendly service,"Stopped here on a whim, turned out to be quite delicious. Shared a palace burger and an Alabama pizza. Tasted like a typical American fast food burger joint and it really hit the spot. Definitely worth a stop here if you're in the mood for fast food that's a step above some other fast food joints. Staff was very friendly. ",5

VACA - Mexican Finger Food,christinasY6908OC,"February 14, 2020",Terrible food!,"Terrible food! Some of the food tasted moldy, and the chicken did not look like anything edible. I really hope I will not be hanging over the toilet all night! The food was filled with dressing and super soggy. Yuck! Also we had to wait over an hour for our order - not ideal with a hungry child at home. Never going to Vaca again. We’ve tried it before without being overly impressed, but decided to give it another go. Never again!",1
VACA - Mexican Finger Food,L0lal0la,"November 23, 2019",Decently priced and tasty - a good experience,"Bumped into this place while looking for a quick and possibly inexpensive option for dinner. The place is small (only a few tables) and a few more smiles from the serving staff would not go amiss, but overall it was a good experience. My partner and I shared guacamole and chips, I had chili con carne and he had a vegetarian burrito. All tasty and filling - and decently priced if you think of the area. Would visit again.",3

If you know the restaurant chain Chipotle in the USA, this is very similar food and actually even more tasty! I am definitely coming back many times. I found out they also deliver throughout JustEat!",5
