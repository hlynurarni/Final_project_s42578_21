Overfor,Morten P,"September 24, 2020",Just an okay place,"The place itself is large, divided into smaller spaces, and really cozy.
But we do not think that the burgers we got was something to boast about, and in the room we were sitting in, we were bothered by the kitchen radio playing loud.",3
Overfor,S K,"June 14, 2019",So sad about the change in food,"We used to love coming to Overfor to have the delicious fish and chips. The fish used to be *incredible* but has been replaced with a smaller portion of cheaper, obviously pre-made, pre-shaped fish sticks consisting of mostly batter. The pasta used to have a variety of mushrooms and truffle oil. Now it's greasy with cheap everything in a smaller portion. No wonder it's noticeably emptier than it used to be. We're sadly not coming back, even though the staff were nice enough.",2
Overfor,autopilot222,"April 4, 2019",The menu is wrong,"They charge you different price, the ipa cost 42kr on the menu but they ask for 49kr. And we asked for the menu price and the girl argued with us",1

Overfor,Chokk,"June 11, 2018",It is a cafe and tries not to be anything else underperforming staff,The staff is friendly and sometimes too young and non-experienced. The food is fair - also fair priced - and the wine and their prices is also okay. Major drawback is that their waiters don't bring their brain to work. We ordered two bottles of wine and none of them were served properly. The first one was served without being open and the second one had already been serving another customer so it had one glass missing. Things like this would not happen if the waiter concentrated on their prime function serving their customers in stead of talking to their fellow waiters.,3
Overfor,szanovics,"February 4, 2018","Ok food, poor service","We went for brunch with a group of friends. Food and coffee were ok but service was disappointing. The waitress was a bit rude and messed up the bill, the system was confusing, food is overpriced and we had dirty cutlery. Overall, the brunch isn't worth the price.",2

Overfor,AddieHNO,"November 7, 2016",Very average,"Very crowded as there was a Forum event, which made the staff stressed and not very friendly.

I have to confess that I did not eat but all the food that passed me looked great. The beer selection was excellent and it also had a full bar. The only demerit was trying to pay the bill which took a while to find our server and pay.,4
Overfor,TexasGunnie,"May 30, 2016",recommended by hotel and didn't disappoint,across from the Forum metro stop.  Can dine inside or out.  Good basic menu with lots of drink options.

Overfor,ultraviolet_v,"March 20, 2015","The breakfast of my life, fantastic atmosphere and great, friendly staff","That's the fastest review I have ever done! The place is so cosy and the staff extremely friendly. This amazing place is at the opposite side of Forum metro station and has a great wi-fi connection. I ordered a breakfast from the morning board (wasn't in English, but the bartender translated for me, there is everything), had a croissant with chocolate (fresh and big, and much tastier than the one I had a day ago in Andersen Bakery, which was from the previous day, I guess!), bread and butter, slices of salami, green leaves, half of ready to eat avocado, at additional price: a glass of orange&carrot juice and shot of espresso! Wonderful!!! Overfor is bigger than it looks from the street and it seems also to be a great option for dinner. I think I did a kind of mistake, dining the previous night in Radio. Here is really cosy! I enjoyed the breakfast and it's a shame I neglected the place. Don't do my mistake and enjoy the food, service and atmosphere of this gorgeous place!",5

I am not sure if they had a fixed menu in occasion of the Cirque du Soleil show at the nearby Forum, but I though the choice of dishes was a bit limited... Only 5 or 6 to choose from.

OL OG Grill,stéphane G,"September 11, 2019",Avoid,Fish was cold and not tasty at all French fries was dry and the rémoulade sauce was coming straight from the industrial container. The only good thing is the location. The waiter was not even friendly. Tourist trap I learned my lesson.,1

Dong Yuan,drcpjohnsonltd,"October 7, 2019",No sweet and mainly sour ; a disappointing oriental experience....,"I went to this restaurant with friends on the last night of an excellent break to Copenhagen where until then, the food and service had been exemplary...the first issue was the Chinese waiter who maintained the sourest expression imaginable ( does he practice this?) right through the meal from the moment he told us they had no pancakes left to go with the crispy duck (this is a first but I guess this can happen...). Now the food ....The bbq rib(s) starter was literally a single rib cut into 4 bone cubes... The beef in the sizzling dish and the chicken in spicy sauce dish appeared to have been broiled for so long that it was too soft and to ensure that there wasn’t a remnant of flavour left to guide the diner to as to the nature of the meat presented; without the benefit of good eyesight you wouldn’t have a chance. The duck dish and the fried rice were good. Sorry guys but this has been voted our worst Chinese food experience to date.",2

In retrospect, we found that Dong Yuan was the 11th of 31 Chinese restaurants and 756th of 1444 restaurants in Copenhagen. The ambiance of the restaurant augmented our culinary experience. The servers: two young men and a lady provided us with attentive, courteous professional and prompt service. We ordered crabmeat and asparagus soup for starters. Then we ordered Tofu with Mixed Vegetables and Fried White Fish with green and red peppers served sizzling in a hot iron plate (see photos). We had a delicious, freshly prepared and authentic Shanghai food.

Well sized portions and the most tender chicken I have ever had. A bottle of Carlsberg beer 25.- and coke 20.-. The service could be improved. It took them 5 minutes to notice us and give us a table.

The first sign of trouble is that the place has only 2 other tables of people at dinner and none of them are Chinese except for us. The second sign is that there are plates and forks/knives on the table instead of bowls n chopsticks. This place, while it has typical Chinese decor, caters to westerners. The menu proves it. A typical Chinese restaurant can tell you what the fresh vegetables of the day are and let you choose...the waiter looked at us blankly and said it was just mixed veg. He was also surprised we ordered Chinese tea...which is usually free at Chinese restaurants but here cost $40 kr. Portions are small...there's more food in a take away box for one than the plate of veg and plate of fish we ordered combined. It wasnt really enough for 2 people at all. The food was edible...nothing to recommend it except it was hot. If we weren't so tired and the fact it was close to our hotel, we wouldn't have stayed. We ate quickly n left as soon as we could. Better choices can definitely be had elsewhere! Btw, tips r included in Denmark so service is never that great anyways. ",2

There was only one other table of customers (in addition to someone who appeared to be an employee eating in the dining room). The waitress clearly had not beed waiting on the other table and took a while to seat me. Once I had a menu, she just disappeared. I kept trying to make eye contact multiple times to no avail, and was at the point where I wanted to leave when she came over. I ordered my meal, and she asked what I had wanted to drink. The waitress rolled her eyes when I asked for tap water. I had intentionally inspected the menu to see if there was a charge for tap water, and there was none listed. As an American who is used to free tap water, I realize that not all restaurants in Europe offer it for free, but the ones who don't, from my experience at least state the price on the menu. At the end of the meal, the waitress had again disappeared, so I approached the takeaway counter to pay (as I was tired of sitting and waiting for her to just not show up). I was surprised when she said my bill was 105dkk, and told her the dish I ordered was 85dkk. She then said there was a 20dkk charge for the water. From what I had seen on the menu, I could have gotten other drinks for that price. The waitress seemed very smug and unapologetic about it, and I felt as if I may have been charged the extra 20dkk to pad the bill. I paid it but will never go back there.

I was curious what the veggie burger was made out of (chickpeas, black bean, tofu, etc ?) and my friend wanted to know what was in the salad but both of the girls who were working were completely clueless and totally unhelpful. The best I got for the veggie burger is ""when I checked the ingredients two weeks ago it said vegetables"" lol and the other girl gave an equally awesome description for the salad. When I continued to ask what kind of vegetables one of them snapped back ""sorry I don't have time to memorize all the vegetables off by heart"" again lol So my friend and I decided to hope for the best and go for the salad. Kudos to the chef because these salads turned out to be awesome! Very happy with our choice but if you're a first timer here don't expect any help from the staff to inform you on the ingredients. BUT if you do decide to get the salad it comes with a delicious combination of fava beans, Lima beans, some kind of hearty green lettuce (possibly kale?) sliced radishes, cucumber, parsley, celery, red cabbage, cherry tomatoes, a green herb sauce on top and some sprouts to garnish. :) ",4

You just have to walk a few meters from the main cafe and then cross the street. We met friends for drinks on the place by the lake. It was a rainy day, and a little bit chilly, but luckily it was covered and the heaters were on so we could get dried a little bit.

At that point I was looking after a place, with outdoor sitting, to meet with some friends. I remembered that all the time I crossed Queen Louise's bridge I saw a nice terrace by the Peblinge Lake, with many people enjoying the sunny days there. This memories made me want to try this place. So together with my friends I went there on a Saturday. The place was almost full, especially the seats by the lake. No one from cafe's side came to welcome us, or to seat us, so we moved around until we found the spot we liked. Then, we found the menus, both for food and drinks. They have white a variety of drinks and sandwiches. When we decided what we wanted, we had to go to the bar to order. However, at the bar we learned that there could be ordered only the drinks; for the food we had to go and order at the main building of the cafe, somewhere over the street. Yet, we had a beer, which costed 65 Danish Crowns, and went to order the food. Once at the desk, ready to order, the waitress, from the beginning told us that if you want to order food, the average waiting time was of about 40 minutes!!!!

We proceeded to wait an additional half hour for decent food, but the wait and attitude was NOT worth it. If we had not paid upfront we would certainly have left.

When a customer comes up to ask where his club sandwich is, that he ordered 35 minutes ago, you missed 2 courtesy points. First off, when you say ""I'll go find out"", then actually put your coffee down, and do it.. Secondly, when you bring the food over, actually saying something like ""sorry for the delay"" would be a nice touch, instead of just putting it on the table without a word...

The place was originally a fish and seafood retailer run by the owner’s father and was completely redone and modernized into artisan retail space and reopened in April 2017 as a counter ordering, limited service format. The lobster is actually sourced from Maine, USA (where my husband’s attended college) and we are always searching for good lobster rolls. The lobster roll was delicious with a delectable brioche bun with a yummy dill tartar style sauce inside and there was plenty of lobster meat (often lacking in low quality lobster rolls). The menu offers four different fish options for fish and chips and they will show you the raw fish options. We went with the most expensive which was cod and the fish was mouthwateringly good, perfectly cooked and actually was coated in planko (like bread crust flakes). The homemade tartar sauce was really excellent. We chatted with the owner named Rahil at length, a delightful man in his early thirties with tremendous passion for fresh, artisan food. Highly recommend trying this amazing seafood restaurant!",5

I had the Ravioli:steaming hot,plump and yummy,with lots of FRESH Parmiggiano,truly yummy and too much even though I was pretty hungry.My husband had the steak,tender and moist,perfectly medium fried,with various sauteed bell peppers,mushrooms and asparagus,plus PERFECT fries and a good sauce. We had hoped to sample some of their desserts,but were quite frankly too full to manage any,even though the vanilla ice cream with espresso sounded tempting.... So,for two dinners,one beer and one glass of good red wine plus water,we paid DKK339,- which is a very good price for such good-quality food! We may have found us a new favorite restaurant in Vesterbro,Copenhagen...",5

Things started really well with an excellent smoked fish course followed by some beautiful white asparagus with truffle and parmesan, but things fell apart a bit after that with 2 disappointing meat courses. I think I might just have got unlucky with the pieces of meat I was served with as my wife thoroughly enjoyed hers, but my steak course was virtually inedible - a seriously tough, sinewy piece of meat, not suited to being served medium-rare, with an uninspiring insipid sauce.

Kul,KK_170513,"April 8, 2014",Another Michelin starred chef going informal!,We decided to invite our still young at heart adult children there. That was a good choice. A former Michellin starred chef and his sous chef have decided to go informal and open an New York style informal restaurant in the now very trendy former meat packing district in Copenhagen. It's great for meat eaters and the young ones loved what they ordered. The concept is that it is tapas style and you order dishes with no specific courses. They strongly recommend three each but we went for two each at the clear disappointment of our waiter. We were right. We then managed to squeeze in dessert as the third choice. The prices are high when you add them up. My personal problem was that I am not a red meat eater but happily went as there were two fish options on the menu. Both were not available that night so there was only two other small dishes in the shell fish category that I could possibly eat. I think it would be good if they found other alternatives and maybe a vegetarian one for example. Clearly the Michelin talent came through with dishes beautifully presented and creatively made. One waiter was rather rude shouting at some customers having difficulty shutting the door when the curtain stuck. Maybe that was a one off but they can still work on that bit as they only opened 5 months ago and are probably still ironing out the edges. Overall delicious for meat eaters and maybe I will call first about availability of fish before I go next time.,4

The place is tucked down a small side street around the corner from their butcher shop & I doubt that we would have found it if it were not for the tour. Michael was the Cheese Meister when we visited and he was an amazing character. We sampled several cheeses plus a pork & cheese sausage. Each cheese was accompanied by a little history and local cultural color provided by Michael. This was our first stop and it certainly bode well for the rest of the day. In the end it was also one of our favorite stops. If you are going to be in Copenhagen for a few days highly recommend you visit the cheese shop early and pick up some cheese to snack on during your stay.

Two tiny drumsticks in BBQ sauce, but the BBQ sauce was clearly smeared on after the drumstick came out of the oven and had not been applied to the chicken prior to going in the oven.

We arrived and ordered food to hear some other guests complaining about the food and service but we looked past it. The owner of the restaurant (the rudest man I've ever met in the restaurant business) had some friends in the restaurant so they were given the best treatment possible, it was embarrassing! He ordered the waitresses to put a table cloth on their table and their table only. He was running around the place making sure their order was pushed before everyone else's and their food arrived causing our food and many others around us to be over an hour late. The owner pulled a chair out on my leg twice making room for his friends, it was so bad it was almost like a comedy sketch!! The wait was so long and having to watch this man with dreadful body odour treat his staff like dirt we nearly walked out twice but figured we had waited so long we might as well wait a little longer. Another 40 minutes later the food arrived and it was the worst food I had eaten. More salt than anyone could possibly need and parts of it were still cold from being frozen. After all that when we came to pay they had no change so they were insisting people pay by card. Overall it was beyond awful and with there being so many great places to eat please go elsewhere. The only positives of this place is the central location and the other waitresses were all friendly, however DO NOT eat here.",1

The host/server appeared annoyed with having to seat us and take our order. I stopped in the men's room to wash my hands. I was thoroughly disgusted. Not only was there no soap, but there was a running broken urinal covered with a clear plastic bag. The water was cloudy and the bag looked ready to burst at any moment because the water was slowly filling the bag and the bathroom reeked. The women's bathroom had a broken door so you could see into the bathroom. I was turned off but my party decided to stay just because they didn't feel like looking. I had the spicy miso soup, which was tolerable. It lacked season but I needed something warm. I ordered the rice with seafood (a danish looking paella) that also lacked flavor. The rest of my party had the burgers, which looked really good but were dry. The server rarely checked to see if we needed anything and appeared agitated throughout our experience.

The burger was ok, although the buns were cold, and chicken a bit dry, which was the same situation for the chicken in my chimichanga - it was very dry.

Le Diamant,Jeremy G,"February 14, 2015",I would not take my dog here!,"Was at Le Diamant with a friend, walked in off the street, expected a quick meal and drink, did not expect what happened. To put it in brief, disgustingly off food! Ridiculously moronic and ill informed staff, loud music blaring over the speakers. This is the kind of place you 'know what to expect', or know what you are walking in to, in other words I had no expectations but after being served practically rotten food and receiving some of the rudest service I have ever been treated to in my life, I think it is safe to say that I will not return, do yourself a favor and do not eat here. !!!!!!!!!!",1

Unfortunately, the food wasn't up to much and nor was the beer. My husband had to send it back after one mouthful, as it was flat with no head!! Not a good start to our romantic lunch! When the meal arrived, my salmon was over cooked and very dry. I have cooked better salmon myself and I'm no chef. My husband had ordered salad which you'd think would be a safe bet but unfortunately he coughed on his food twice during the meal. We didn't complain as we won't be going back. ",1

Very expensive for what we got on our plate which was mediocre at best. Lumpy béarnaise sauce, a steak ordered rare, but was almost well done and fries that were stone cold.

Came across this place with a board listing it's specials which seemed reasonable price. Had rib-eye steak for 99kr which seemd cheap by Copenhagen prices. Restaurant itself seemed quite modern and nice so chanced it even though a quick check on the Copenhagen City Cuide app by Tripadvisor didn't rank it that high. Lady who served us was very cheerful and friendly. had the rib-eye steak done medium and it was excellent - cooked to just as we liked and the meat was very tender and juicy. Excellent fro the price. Not much in the way of vegetables though - three wedges of potatoes and some salad leafs so overall, the portion was not really filling but better quality over quantity. Had a coupl eof Tuborg beers to go with the meals - had bottles which seemed reasonably priced considering we were right in the middle of Copenhagen. Based on the specials that we had, no complaints and decent value.",4

We were in Copenhagen for 3 days before catching our cruise ship and 1 day after the cruise. We ate all, but one meal here.

We had the feeling that everything like the sauce and the dessert was bought completely finished and they just warmed it up. The cake we had as dessert was still a little bit frozen in the middle.

The waiter was really nice, and came filling up our glasses when they were nearly empty. The only thing I can say (this is our own fault) was, that we couldn’t decide between 2 vines. When we asked the waiter which one was the sweetest one, he told us another one.

The bread was perfect: sliced not-too-thick, not-too-thin with a chewy crust. The toppings were fresh and not over-piled, though I still had to eat them with a knife and fork. Extra bonus for the crisp bacon, raw onion, and beet chunks on the leverpostej, which added a good crunch to the otherwise-soft texture.

On the day we arrived right on time, and found there is no reservation, a sad-looking girl showed us to the worst table in the restaurant, and there was no flag of course. It's a tiny depressing place, cheaply/randomly decorated with trashy items. We kept our mouth shut. The table is so small, that if we try to keep the burning candle, the drinking glasses will fall off. If we try to keep the plates on the table, the cutleries will fall off. If we try to accommodate our knees, we cannot keep the chairs straight in place. If we put our jackets on the chairs, they will hang on the dirt behind right on top of the flower-pots! It was a constant struggle. Guests who did not reserve beforehand, and just walked in, they got the best tables. A family with constantly screaming babies occupied the largest center table. And I was eating in a half-standing posture! Only one girl with sad face is serving all the guests all evening, and she made sure to ignore us the whole time, as if we are invisible. These people are so cheap, that they will not hire more service people so they don't have to waste money on salaries, but they will squeeze the eating guests in tin-cans as much as possible so they can make more money! When we ordered, the girl didn't even care to write it down in a notebook! After a long wait and hand-waving and begging to attract the girl's attention, microscopic appetizers arrived, which was not worth 42 Danish crown! Moreover, the main courses gave us diarrhea! And imagine this......the girl expressed her wish to get tips from us!!! Yeah, can you believe that? These Chinese people are running a business in the middle of Denmark's capital city, they cannot even read, write or speak Danish properly. If you write to them, a robot-like reply will arrive, obviously pre-written by a Danish person. If you try to communicate with them about the menu or the food, they would keep it short to just one Danish word and quickly turn their back on you, avoiding eye-contact. Avoid this restaurant.",1

Neither the restaurant nor the food presentation is particularly elegant or sophistictated, but the food is just like what mama would cook. The carpaccio manza was home cured and relatively thickly sliced, the pene was perfectly cooked, al dente, and the pene vegatli was a pleasant surprise for my vegetarian wife who, after several days of much fresh and dried fish, needed a veggie-fix. The restaurant is not inexpensive - approximately $16 for carpaccio $30 for penne cacciatora - the wine list $48 for a reasonable frascati is similarly priced, but workable, other than for wine connoisseurs.

The beers and shots really aren't any better or cheaper than anywhere else, but the seating is meant to generally accommodate groups of 6 -10.

Street side seating and proximity to the lakes makes it an easy place to try. My wife and I tried it a week ago for lunch and found the food prep time to be extraordinarily long for steak and eggs for lunch on a Friday when few were in attendance. The food was good, just a long prep time. I decided to give it another try a week later. Lunch was their “killer burger”. Unfortunately, the meat was far from good. It was well done as in very cooked and extremely dense. Felt like I was biting into a hockey puck. I couldn’t finish it. I advised staff about the disappointment.

French toast was just so-so, and my steak accompanying my eggs did not have much of any flavor to it. I also noticed our friend's pancakes were burned. Have to agree with another reviewer, they could skip the weak coffee and combine best of old (great coffee) and new world (greasy spoon breakfast).

But: the selection is very limited (also: no vegetarian dishes at all!) and the portions are tiny, nouvelle cuisine-style, yet pricy. I asked for some gnocchi in a non-meat, non-fish sauce but apparently it was too complicated to make them, so I chose the alternative: a risotto with mushrooms. The risotto turned out to be as small as the palm of my hand and it actually wasn't a risotto, but a saffran pressed-rice tart with mushrooms over it. Tasted good, but nothing special. The worst thing was, that I was charged ca. 240 DK (about 33 euros) just as if I had eaten the lobster risotto, which to me is not correct at all! My husband was happy with his ravioli, although he also complained with the size of his dish (maybe 7 ravioli?). The chocolate dessert was -again- quite small but very tasty.

Eventyr Lounge,KN0509,"June 18, 2018",Worth a visit,"With access through Priority Pass this was a well-worth visit during breakfast. Although the food on offer was fairly limited it was OK and freshly cooked and sufficient for a quick bite. There seemed to be a reasonable choice of alcohol but as this was early morning I chose to stick to the coffee so I am unable to comment on this. The staff (I think the lounge supervisor) could not have been more welcoming. There was a new staff under training at the front desk that needed a lot of help, but at no point did he show any impatience with her or with the visitors. That was a joy to experience, making the visit a 4 rather than 3 star.",4

I reached Maharaja Amagerbrogade 15, at around 8pm and it was packed, and somehow we managed to get a table since we booked a table earlier. Well we ordered panner mutter, aalu gobi, tandoori roti, chapati & a vegetarian biryaani. The food was not Indian taste and tandoori roti was pathetic, very very hard. Biryani quantity was big but it taste like pulav, all in all it was not Indian taste we had over there. There was only one waiter and he says proudly from Afghanistan, who was attending all the tables with sweat on his forehead. When we received the bill it was 549 DKK, I came to know that they charged for tap water, when I asked about the same & the waiter replied it was just negligible amount 30 Kr for water since I had not ordered any drink that's why they charged for water.

Indian Restaurant Maharaja,kenneme,"June 8, 2012","May be good for Copenhagen, but dissapointing overall","The service was nice - friendly waiters and a decent decor (typical Euorpean Indian restaurant). The food was bland and boring, not much flavor and chewy cheese with no taste in the paneer I got. I meant to order ""extra spicey"" but forgot - maybe the food would have been better if I had. There were plenty of vegetarian and meat options on the menu, fairly typical Indian/Pakistani menu you could find anywhere. The Lassi was good and presentation of the dishes was nice. The garlic nan was more like a regular European bread cooked flat - too tense and dry. If it had not been so pricey I would have been ok with the whole experience, but overall the food was poor and when they added an extra 5% fee to use my foreign credit card it was the cherry on the not-so-nice cake. I left dissapointed and with a sour stomach. Perhaps in Copenhagen there is not much competition and few immigrants from southeast Asia, so it could be a treat for locals (and maybe the owners adapted the cooking to local tastes), but if you've ever enjoyed a good Indian restaurant in the UK or even average US standards, you won't be impressed. Also looks out on a busy street, so not very nice for spring/summer dining.",3

As for Nørrebro Bryghus I find the beer great (some of the best in DK) and the food in the cafe (downstairs) to be reasonably priced (upstairs cost a fair penny more).",4

However we booked our table at 730 hoping to go into Tivolli to see the fireworks at 10pm - however we hadn't even got our main course at this stage. Whilst I liked that we were not rushed, the service was not very attentive and drinks ordered on the arrival of our main course never arrived but we're on our bill. Whilst the waiters were generally friendly and I understand it was there new year too, it did feel disorganised. It was also unclear how we got our prepaid entry to Tivolli.

Tips to those who are curious to try this restaurant: make it sure you know what you're paying for. I paid for the buffet and medium size soft drinks for 293.00 DKK. If the buffet costs 228.00 DKK, does it means that the soft drink costs 65.00 DKK? Just realised it when I got home so it was too late to complain. If that was really the price of the softdrink, then I guess it's quite a bit expensive. If that was not the price, I hope the management will hire a more efficient, reliable and service-minded waitress. ",1
